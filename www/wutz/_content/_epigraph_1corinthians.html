<blockquote>
    <q>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most
    by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. But if there be no
    interpreter, let him keep silence in the church;<br/>and let him speak to
    himself, and to God.</q>
    &ndash; 1 Corinthians 14
