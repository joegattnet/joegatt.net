      <div>&quot;Within the last few decades, in countries like Britain or the United States, the literary intelligentsia has grown large enough to constitute a world in itself. One important result of this is that the opinions which a writer feels frightened of expressing are not those which are disapproved of by society as a whole. To a great extent, what is still loosely thought of as heterodoxy has become orthodoxy. It is nonsense to pretend, for instance, that at this date there is something daring and original in proclaiming yourself an anarchist, an atheist, a pacifist, etc. The daring thing, or at any rate the unfashionable thing, is to believe in God or to approve of the capitalist system. In 1895, when Oscar Wilde was jailed, it must have needed very considerable moral courage to defend homosexuality. Today it would need no courage at all: today the equivalent action would be, perhaps, to defend antisemitism. But this example that I have chosen immediately reminds one of something else-namely, that one cannot judge the value of an opinion simply by the amount of courage that is required in holding it.&quot; (George Orwell).</div>

      <div>In the early 17th century, a Frenchman, Jacques Sadeur, spent 35 years in Australia (or rather, La Terre Australe). When he eventually got back to Europe, he wrote a book about it, first published in Geneva in 1676. He describes our national character rather well - for example, one Australian tells him that &apos;&apos;We make a profession of all being equal, our glory consists in being all alike; all the difference that there is, is only in finding out new inventions that the discoverers may contribute them to the public good.&apos;&apos; etc.</div>

      <div>Pynchon&apos;s portrayal of Valletta, one of the many possible Vs is quite telling. Especially, since most other writers about Malta have been firmly set in the post-colonial mindset (Burgess, for instance). Without over-exoticising his subject Pynchon draws a haunting portrait of Valletta and has a decent grasp of the political attitudes and circumstances surrounding the Sette Giugno riots.</div>

      <div>For a long time, science did not understand how insects flew. Their aerodynamic mechanism did not add up. More recently, it has been discovered that to such small creatures the air is far more viscous than it is to us. This is the kind of thing that Jonathan Swift could have easily explained to them. Swift takes care to note, for instance, the relative stiffness of fabric as his relative size changes.</div>

      <div>Even the name, Ulisse, is problematic. Although Maltese includes many Italian words, and the syntax is Romance, there is such a thing as over-Italianity, to the Maltese mind easily associated with crypto-fascists (and the name itself does sound like a parody name an over-Italianate father, perhaps a member of the Balilla, may have given to his son in the 1930s). Italian first names are pretentious - as are, indeed, Maltese names borne by anyone under the age of fifty. Although many people are called by their Maltese names as a term of endearment (the equivalent of &apos;mate&apos;) and indeed many mothers have seen it as an advantage to give their children names which can&apos;t be Maltesised (&apos;Godwin&apos;, &apos;Gladys&apos;). There usually comes a point in my friendships at which people learn my full name. A glance of my passport, perhaps (along with seeing a photo of me from when I had hair). What would be an unremarkable Catholic name in any Romance language - Joseph Mary - Anglicised...</div>

      <div>It is an easy temptation to use a shortcut translation: From English to Latinate English to Italian to Maltese. Especially seeing as there is, conveniently, a very authoritative Italian translation, co-translated by no less than Joyce himself. But this is not necessarily a perfect solution. Firstly, Italian does not fulfil the entire genius of the Maltese language. Although many words fit very happily into the language, over-use makes Maltese sound as overbearingly Latinate as Johnson&apos;s English. Worse still, it can sound legalistic - Italian was Malta&apos;s legal language for centuries.</div>

      <div>In Maltese, because the corpus is so small, there is always the problem of attribution. The language can sound thin, because each usage has occurred comparatively rarely - only a few steps away from a hapax legomenon. There isn&apos;t really a loamy substructure validating usage - or supporting (and contextualising) its outrage. But just as every language sees its scripture (KJV, Luther&apos;s bible &amp; Book of Common Prayer) in Maltese, also, the language most imbued by a genius is the language of prayer, reaching eloquence: &quot;Sliem ghalik Sultana, Omm tal hniena Hajja helwa Tama taghna.&quot; Indeed, perhaps only things learnt by rote really reach the &apos;substructure&apos; of our linguistic minds. Maybe like &apos;mother&apos;s cooking&apos; these prayers, learnt by rote, become archetypal... even if one&apos;s mother was a mediocre cook, &apos;home cooking&apos; remains the archetype because the mother being invoked here is a collective mother....</div>

      <div>&quot;There is an obvious resemblance betweeen an unreadable script and a secret code; similar methods can be employed to break both. But the differences must not be overlooked. The code is deliberately designed to baffle the investigator; the script is only puzzling by accident. [...] Secondly, the script may be known, the language unknown. This is the case of Etruscan, which is written in a modified form of the Greek alphabet that presents little difficulty to the understanding of its sounds...&quot;</div>

      <div>Chapter: Inherit the wind... quote senator who said &quot;this is what happens when you teach evolution: school massacres.&quot; True, in a way but &apos;worth it&apos;. We need to accept the fact that our freedoms do have a price. Every previous set of beliefs has admitted it. We can&apos;t keep pretending that it&apos;s a win-win situation. We should not predicate our beliefs on the crucial test of their universal harmlessness - that would be the ultimate form of blindness and arrogance.

      <div>My position really is this: my dichotomy is British Imperialism/Catholic Church. My adolescent rebellion was against the Church... but increasingly I realise that anti-Catholicism is expressed invariably in protestant, Anglo-Saxon, British, terms.

      <div>The Unpenetrated Text: German has trademarks, as French has trademarks, curlicues etc... To, say, a chinese man completely ignorant of Italian and English, the writing is indistinguishable, but German has marks a) umlauts b) capital letters for nouns c) the old-fashioned SS... Reminescent of that old fashioned typography (called?) which, ironically popular with neo-Nazis was actually outlawed by Hitler. (A repealed typography - unique instance?).

      <div>Describe the experience in detail of looking at a foreign language text. This is where we are establishing the book as boject mirabilis. This would be the step after the chosistic reading of the text, reading it with a recognition of it as a foreign-language text. Snow-blind, our eyes slide over the edges - there is no purchase. Greyness, or colour, of the page. &apos;Unwittingly&apos; use references to typography in descriptions. Harmonic gait. Whether one actually &apos;reads&apos; such a text is debatable. The mind, desperate perhaps to interpret the visual symbols, finds itself enunciating the letters and words.</div>

      <div>Theodicy, etc. Did the political requirements of having a strong Germany affect the intellectual reception to the Holocaust? Apolitical. Why has the political responsibility been generalised to the whole of humanity - to become a sort of secular notion of Original Sin? And then, contradictorily, suggesting that Hitler did not have direct knowledge of the Holocaust is tantamount to Holocaust denial. A recent poster for an Imperial War Museum exhibition read something along the lines of &quot;look what humanity is capable of&quot; rather than, of course, &quot;look what the Germans did, look what the Germans of the 30s and 40s were capable of, look what the Germans of the 30s and 40s did not resist, etc&quot;. Has something similar happened with South Africa&apos;s Truth &amp;amp; Reconciliation Committee? Judging by most of the South Africans I&apos;ve met, there&apos;s very little national sense of responsibility. Atrocity becomes a natural phenomenon - yet another reason to have no faith in man. That, as the Christian original sin necessitated redemption so this secular original sin requires humility. Is this a personal gripe of mine, having none of the baggage of large countries and at the same time seeing my enthusiasm for &apos;Western&apos; progress dampened by wet blankets who seem to have become bored - and so self-assured as to be complacent - with all they acquired and achieved and now want to preach parsimony to the rest of us. And drawing conclusions on behalf of humanity. At the same time, there is a tendency not to generalise the beauty of humanity&apos;s achievements, but rather to personalise these. [28.01.02 09:49] Swift&apos;s A Modest Proposal is apropos of this [Why?] (also Defoe&apos;s deliberately misunderstood parallel work). This seems to be a problem of synecdoche.</div>

      <div>The image of exhaling cigarette smoke is one which can only be captured in motion. Still images of the actual act of exhaling smoke normally look ridiculous unless perfectly staged, the smoke choreographed. And yet, the most arresting quality of the image is the stillness of the smoker.</div>

      <div>I have great admiration for people who have documented their projects (Borges, Mallermé, Roussell ) and - out of indolence, indifference or good taste - have not gone on to realise them. But I envy their great industry in articulating their projects. This is something which I can&apos;t even seem to manage. Is this the difference between Modernist doubt and post-Modernist frenzy?</div>

      <div>Zeno (he of the Conscience) is told by a hypochondriac friend that there are fifty-four muscles involved in the simple act of walking. This knowledge haunts Zeno and for the rest of his life he tends to limp and, when trying to impress women, in-laws or business partners, has to make a conscious effort not to. Modernism and post-Modernism in a line. The friend feels superior to Zeno, whom he considers a malade imaginaire and every time they meet, there is a lot of one-upmanship. Zeno seems to acknowledge his friend&apos;s superiority and aspires to his authenticity.</div>

      <div>The text as a vocal score - as such it can be &apos;interpreted&apos;. (See Wittgenstein, Tractatus, 4.0141.) Insofar as the text is a transcription of speech, I can still recreate - quite mechanically - the speech-events which it documents, as obliviously as a gramophone needle dips and bobs [tautologous] on the grooves of a record to re-vibrate the air with those original vibrations. I can read it out aloud, such that a German could just about understand me - though, like the stylus bobbing on a record - we are oblivious to the meaning of the words... Slapstick situations where this might be useful.</div>

      <div>A common cautionary tale in my childhood concerned the saddest moment of an atheist&apos;s life. It was not, we were told, when he was sad and needed to ask for help but when he was happy and had no one to thank. This intransitive gratitude... As a cautionary tale, this is useless. What human being - believer or not - would not envy this hypothetical atheist who experiences such moments of joy? (Cf CIA having to maintain an image of the Soviet Union as both a plausible enemy - ie technologically and economically capable - and undesirable.).</div>

      <div>The faith in secularism, seems to me, similar to a faith in the free-market. It is transcendental, at least to an epistemological degree, in the sense that it believes that the logic of existence is such that it will balance itself out to the self-evident good of mankind. This is not only superstitious but stubborn. Touching, but naive to believe that the logic of existence is is so positively laid out is not so far from Leibniz&apos;s assertion - much parodied by Voltaire in Candide - that this is the best possible world.
The phrase, &apos;faith in secularism&apos; may seem wrongheaded but it can be put in no other way. For surely every system believes in itself. Especially when it is not based on empirical evidence.</div>

      <div>During World War II, Beichman published the first American reports of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, having found a man who had escaped from the battles and could provide maps and a firsthand account. After the war, he interviewed Holocaust survivors as they landed in New York. He came across one beautiful young woman who had seen her five children killed but who had been kept around to serve the Nazi officers. Beichman innocently asked her how she could have preserved the will to live after her children&apos;s murder. &quot;That&apos;s what I cannot forgive God for,&quot; she replied. &quot;You still want to live no matter what. But I will never have children. That I know.&quot;.</div>

      <div>There was a hierarchical system similar to airline seat classification - euphemistically diluted to give the impression that no lower rungs existed.

(Neatly punning with the actual position on a 747.) You have first class but no second class (see what airlines calls them) a system that seems to allow privilege without oppression.

      <div>Nobody Home. One of the RAF&apos;s plans for a next-generation fighter is called the Uninhabited combat plane [check proper name] - the choice of the word uninhabited rather than unmanned is, we are told, a nod to political correctness. This has a peculiar circular logic to it, because &apos;unmanned&apos; would not have excluded women but men. It would have implied that a vehicle was missing a man, or would have assumed that... It&apos;s inaccurate because the plane would render mostly men obsolete and calling it uninhabited would suggest that women used to fight jet planes too - which they mostly didn&apos;t. It&apos;s as though writing history for generations... Link with european money / shakespeare left out because he&apos;s a jew?</div>

      <div>It&apos;s very hard to reconcile the paradigm of rights / democracy to the one of duty / religion.
Such as the struggle for homosexual recognition within the christian church.
It is pointless to argue that homosexuality is natural because one of the functions of religion has always been to eradicate the natural - the ten commandments are basically a catalogue of natural inhibitions - it is perfectly normal in the jungle to deceive, kill, abandon your parents and fornicate.
Religion has always been about man&apos;s self-consciousness as a species to raise itself above the station of animals - to justify its claim against all other species (thus God gave Adam the power to name all the other animals).
With the acceptance of homosexuality it makes it even more complex because it&apos;s hard enough to try to convince the christian establishment that homosexuality is &apos;natural&apos; in the first place, let alone trying to ...
It&apos;s as though the homosexual lobby is trying to do exactly what man originally did with its obvious natural functions: sacramentalise them, to give them some sort of higher meaning, a divine endorsement...</div>

When I get up before her and leave her in the warm bed - we kiss fondly and touch and it&apos;s a perfectly beautiful goodbye, a combination of loss and re-affirmation, a pleasurable-denial kind of goodbye.

      <div>&quot;In 1951, Lacks, a mother of four then just entering her 30s, was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital with cervical cancer. A piece of her tumor was removed and, as it happens, passed on by the pathologist to a researcher who was trying to grow human tissue in vitro. The cells from Henrietta Lacks-labeled HeLa-were astonishing. Unlike other human cell lines, which would grow for a while and then peter out, HeLa proliferated nonstop and consumed food voraciously. They seemed to have no senescence clock, no suicide program. Since this made them perfect for studying human cell biology, they were distributed to researchers all over the world. They were even sent into orbit aboard the Discover 17 satellite.&quot;.</div>

      <div>Television adverts announcing new television sets always have a built-in deficiency. They are trying to show you how clear, how vivid, the new model&apos;s picture is - but anything they try to show you is obviouly limited by the clarity of your own picture. They will show you trees growing out of a sky as painted by the mirror surface of a lake. But the lake is only as clear as your own television set can depict it. They will show you a smiling woman, the clarity of whose skin breaks your heart - well, depending on the clarity that your own screen can reproduce. They will boast of new-fangled flatness and squareness - but the curvature of your screen will compromise their message. After all, if the clarity and the flatness and the squareness does reach you uncompromised - then you do not need a new television set.
My meditations on silence here will be victims of the same paradox. I will try to use words to talk about silence, I will try to use words not to set things in motion, not to vibrate the air or excite the mind but to still it. Like a lullaby. To kill the breeze of sound.
Maybe the whole point of the television advert is that the clarity reaches you compromised. You will look at the compromised lake and the compromised youth, as diminished by the ageing phosphor of your own screen, compare them to the real thing, or rather the idealised thing, of your memory and you will wonder at the prowess of this new model.
Water is always the emblem of clarity. We shall also use it as the emblem of silence. It is, after all, the best conductor of sound (better than a solid). Space cheats, space is not silent - because it cannot be noisy in the first place.</div>

LT said she felt funny saying it in English so she said &apos;sim sim&apos; in Portuguese. She said some other things, which I didn&apos;t understand. Then, of course, she said &quot;Joe, I want to fuck with you.&quot; I laughed. She said it&apos;s not the best time for it... (Of course, as it turned out, and without meaning to, she did fuck with me.) ZH had repeated &quot;ahxini, ahxini&quot;. EJ wouldn&apos;t talk dirty in Polish, though she did in English. Once she said, &apos;I want you to take me from the back side.&apos; I wasn&apos;t sure what she meant, so under the guise of wanting to repeat the pleasure of hearing her, I asked her to repeat and listened out for that crucial space. Still wasn&apos;t sure so I took the safe route. In Krakow she put K-Y on the bedside table.</div>

      <div>The Man Without Qualities is unique among the European canon of Modernist novels to be written in the third person. Is this significant? Did the decision exercise Musil much. Ulysses, of course is not really written in the first person; the level to which the narration dives almost suggests an omniscient narrator who can &apos;hear&apos; things which the characters themselves cannot, going as it does beneath the consciousness and possibly articulating thoughts which the characters themselves could not. (Remember that there are parts of Ulysses written in the third person.).</div>

      <div>&quot;Any mentally idle, story-hungry novelist or scriptwriter would do well to attend to the entangled and twisted lives of Friedrich and Elisabeth Nietzsche, which present ready-made a nearly perfect narrative. Most real lives need a good deal of cutting and pasting to get them into story shape. Here no complicated restructuring is required: you have only to start at the beginning and go on to the end (Friedrich&apos;s ending before he ended; Elisabeth&apos;s continuing long after her demise) and you have as rich a tale of human relations and mental worlds as any reader or viewer could stomach.&quot;</div>

But the sailors could not understand the song, they took it for the howling of the storm. And these things were never to be beautiful for them; for if the ship sank, the men were drowned, and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King&quot; [TRACE quote cf].</div>

Of this nature was his employment who made it his business to compute into how many several orders the letters of the alphabet might be transposed, and found out that incredible number mentioned in Plutarch.&quot;</div>

      <div>&quot;Homosexuality was not really defined until the later 19th century, and some theorists have suggested that it didn&apos;t actually exist before it was named; that before the doctors gave it a label it was something which simply offered a series of possible sexual acts to anyone. There is more in this than Robb allows, and certainly some surprising people gave it a go. Flaubert had sex with a boy in Cairo, and Voltaire thought it worth trying, once: when his partner in joy suggested a repeat experiment, Voltaire politely turned him down, saying, &apos;Once, a philosopher; twice, a sodomite.&apos;&quot;</div>

      <div>When he found himself unable to write, one of the things that frustrated him most was the way he could only describe the impasse as &quot;writer&apos;s block&quot;. Of course, he could find other ways of putting it but they all seemed circumspect.

      <div>Publisher&apos;s blurb: Widely acclaimed throughout Latin America after its 1992 release in Argentina, &quot;The Absent City&quot; takes the form of a futuristic detective novel. In the end, however, it is a meditation on the nature of totalitarian regimes, on the transition to democracy after the end of such regimes, and on the power of language to create and define reality. Ricardo Piglia combines his trademark avant-garde aesthetics with astute clinical and political insights into Argentina&apos;s history and contemporary condition in this conceptually daring and entertaining work. The novel follows Junior, a reporter for a daily Buenos Aires newspaper, as he attempts to locate a secret machine that contains the mind and memory of a woman named Elena. While Elena produces stories that reflect on actual events in Argentina, the police are seeking her destruction because of the revelations of atrocities that she - the machine - is disseminating throught texts and taped recordings. The book thus portrays the race to recover the history and memory of a city and a country where history has largely been obliterated by political repression. Its narratives - all part of a detective story, all part of something more - multiply as they intersect with each other, like the streets and avenues of Buenos Aires itself. The second of Piglia&apos;s novls to be translated by Duke University Press - the first was &quot;Artificial Respiration&quot; -this book continues the author&apos;s quest to portray the abuses and arocities that characterize dictatorships as well as the difficulties associated with making the transition to democracy. Translated and with an introduction by Sergio Waisman, it includes a new afterword by the author.</div>

      <div>&quot;In an introduction to a remarkable recent graphic version of his novel Absent City, Ricardo Piglia says the real is not (or doesn&apos;t have to be) the object of a representation &apos;but the space where a fantastic world takes place&apos;. He is describing the case of a man living in Buenos Aires who has in his house a finely detailed model of the city. The man is mad because he thinks the life of the real city depends on what happens in the model, but this is only to say that he has misunderstood a relation, not that the model has nothing to say to us. Climbing the stairs to look at the miniature city, Piglia says - thinking of the graphic version of his own book as itself a model, and by implication of many other kinds of replication and revision - &apos;Then I understood what I already knew: what we can imagine already exists, in another scale, in another time, distinct and distant, like a dream.&apos;&quot;</div>

      <div>Ritual humility is a familiar trope of the unhumble: &quot;Overwhelmed&quot; by the honour, Steiner name-checks the modern masters who mounted the Norton podium before him: &quot;I do not regard myself as of the world of Stravinsky, Eliot, Borges and Calvino: the all-time greats.&quot; He insists that &quot;those of us who are not major creators - who are critics, editors, teachers, translators, commentators - have this fantastic privilege of carrying the mail. That&apos;s for me the central image: it comes from Pushkin.&quot; Long before his stint in the Harvard limelight, however, he had grasped that the mail-delivery of teaching might bring peril as well as privilege.&quot;
&quot;I know this has made my position a marginal, and certainly disliked, one. But if Nietzsche - Nietzsche - can speak of Tristan and Isolde as the real mysterium tremendum, then little Mr Steiner need have no illusions.&quot;

      <div>Alain Robbe-Grillet pioneered chosisme, a style of writing which gives the reader nothing but uninterpreted visual data. Then he became quite active in cinema. Which is odd in itself but odder still is the fact that he seemed to use chosistic techniques in his films. I find this odd in the same way that I have always found cubist sculpture. Is this when a true aesthetic becomes a mere aesthetic, a &apos;look&apos;?</div>

      <div>There is a device used very frequently which, and I&apos;m not sure why, I find very annoying. This is the habit of quoting a dictionary to expand the title. This convention seems to delight its disciples with the orthography fractured to show syllables, phonetic suggestions, abbreviated or acronymed parsing information (v.t. &amp; v.i.), the various senses and etymology. The various senses seem to be making some point or other.
I am here trying to see exactly why I don&apos;t like this device. I have no objection to formalism, indeed I should be relieved that it seems to be accepted because my own work tends towards it. Nor is it some great impatience with pomposity; I am cautiosly patient of it since I suspect I am myself guilty of it now and then.
Another caution which has always made me somewhat nervous is, &quot;Show, don&apos;t tell&quot;. Although I can see the wisdom of this advice, my natural style would tend towards making certain things explicit, even as I believe that the work is always about &apos;something else&apos;, meaning that you can never really &apos;tell&apos; all you can do is show - even in the most literal - and perhaps didactic work. I think Wittgenstein alludes to this in the Tractatus. (Or does he make a clear distinction between the two?).</div>

      <div>The length of a work is relevant. It is imaginable that a dish could be represented by a mere spoonful, with each ingredient in the same proportion as in the full dish, this much meat, this much salt and pepper, this much spice and gravy, this much vegetable.... But it is obviously different from the dish. The difference between a miniature painting and a large fresco is intuitive - and the difference must be one of scale - the absolute reference being our own size. Similarly, the absolute reference with fiction must be our own sense of time - our experience and memory.</div>

      <div>From NYRB 15.01.04, p21. Borges&apos;s favourite quotation is from an essay by Chesterton on the painter G.F. Watts: &quot;Man knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless than the colors of an autumn forest. . . . Yet he seriously believes that these things can every one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of his own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire.&quot;.</div>

      <div>&quot;The blind live in a world that is inconvenient, an undefined world from which certain colours emerge: for me, yellow, blue (except that blue may be green), and green (except that green may be blue). White has disappeared, or is confused with gray. As for red, it has vanished completely. But I hope some day - I am following a treatment - to improve and to be able to see that great colour, that colour which shines in poetry, and which has so many beautiful names in many languages. Think of scharlach in German, scarlet in English, escarlata in Spanish, écarlate in French. Words that are worthy of that great colour.&quot;

      <div>A dream: I&apos;m asking BH whether the prince of Wales had come on her face the previous night while I pull her hair and kiss her neck. She describes another scene, a near-orgy the previous night, in which a man and a &apos;gorgeous&apos; girl were with her and they &apos;fooled&apos; around and at the same time both found a place in a creative writing course starting this morning. This wakes me up with an erection and a rage, not jealousy but the Creative writing bit gets to me.</div>

      <div>When amateurs judge your (artistic) work, they will judge it on the grounds of plausibility, &quot;How much does this look like art works I recognise, or could imagine?&quot; Such assessments tend to reward cliché. Even professional criticism is not innocent of this. In fact, commercial endorsement can end up being the most honest form of criticism, as when someone decides to publish you or perform your work. In rare favourable circumstances, the entrepreneurial spirit contains sufficient ability to make a leap of the imagination, wagering on unfamiliar forms.</div>

      <div>I remember a disastrous production of The Duchess of Malfi which included the memorable line, &quot;Dal-lejl kelli ©¤mar-il lejl.&quot; It was boldly declaimed by a very young actor, his voice precariously balanced on the brink of puberty, at a very climactic moment, when half the cast lay dead on the stage. A newspaper critic had suggested that the translator was at fault in this case, for translating nightmare into something which, in Maltese, sounds funny. But why do we find it funny? After all, nightmare is almost literally ©¤mar-il lejl. The donkey may be marginally funnier, but not by much. ¡°Debba tal-lejl,¡± would probably have been almost as funny. The fact that the words remain separate encourage a bit more self-consciousness, but not much. Shakespeare even explicitly plays on the equine possibilities of the word, ¡°the nightmare and her nine foals.¡± [TRACE].</div>

      <div>Steve Reich &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; (1968/1973) for microphones, amplifiers speakers and performers: &quot;Three, four, or more microphones are suspended from the ceiling or from microphone boom stands by their cables so that they all hang the same distance from the floor and are all free to swing with a pendular motion. Each microphone&apos;s cable is plugged into an amplifier which is connected to a loudspeaker. Each microphone hangs a few inches directly above or next to its speaker. Before the performance, each amplifier is turned up just to the point where feedback occurs when a mike swings directly over or next to its speaker, but no feedback occurs as the mike swings to either side. This level on each amplifier is then marked for future reference and all amplifiers are turned down. The performance begins with performers taking each mike, pulling it back like a swing, and then holding them while another performer turns up the amplifier to their pre-marked levels. Performers then release all the microphones in unison. Thus, a series of feedback pulses are heard which will either be all in unison or not depending on the gradually changing phase relations of the different mike pendulums. Performers then sit down to watch and listen to the process along with the rest of the audience. The piece is ended sometime shortly after all mikes have come to rest and are feeding back a continuous tone by performers pulling out the power cords of the amplifier.&quot; Steve Reich August, 1968 - revised May, 1973.</div>

      <div>On Humility vs Modesty: Are all truly great men humble? Is modesty the humility of the scoundrel? Borges was humble to the point of falsehood. There is his famous, repeated, claim that he was always prouder of his reading than of his writing. Also: Remarks pepper his lectures. He even plays down his own blindness and defers to better blindness (Seven Nights, p108) he calls his a &quot;modest blindness&quot;. And goes on to say, &quot;My case is not especially dramatic. What is dramatic are those who suddenly lose their sight.&quot; (Borges could still see colours, his blindness was a long drawn-out twilight of the spectrum. Last to go was yellow. [TRACE in PEN where, tongue-in-cheek, he plays down his own modesty and says my modesty is nothing compared to....]. RIPE.</div>

      <div>Does it help at all trying to imagine the voice I want to write with? It&apos;s probably an inhibition. I know all those things I want to avoid: loudness, boredom, etc. I want the writing not to have too many proper names in it - but that can end up sounding pretentious. I want to avoid clichés and too many colloquialisms, though I don&apos;t want it to sound too much like translationese. (This is a very real danger. Most of my recent reading has consisted of translations.).</div>

      <div>&quot;Vexations (1893) This is a sort of condensation of his Rosicrucian music. The basic material is extremely simple: a theme in bass, a cantus firmus, without time-signature or bars, encompassing thirteen beats and all the twelve tones of the chromatic scale but one (A flat/ G sharp).The theme then becomes the basis for two harmonisations, identical but inverted and using only dimished and augmented triads (every chord but one includes a tritone). If you call the basis theme A and both harmonisations B and C, the form of the piece can be written ABAC. What makes this piece so debated was the odd note added to the music by Satie: &quot;In order to play this motif 840 times to yourself, it will be useful to prepare yourself beforehand, in great silence and serious immobility.&quot;</div>

      <div>There is something of a moral rule-of-thumb nowadays, that failing to believe the worst available rumour about anyone, is somehow - in itself - corrupt. How many people, for instance, who believe that the Catholic Church acted against the Jews in the 20th Century have ever read any article on the subject to the end. Does this come from the Holocaust? (&quot;Believe everything.&quot;) The 20th Century has taught us that the worst is the safest bet.</div>

      <div>&quot;[95:] The poor man has no need of education. The education of his own station in life is forced upon him; he can have no other. The education received by the rich man from his own station is least fitted for himself and for society, whereas a natural education should fit a man for any position. Now it is more unreasonable to train a poor man for wealth than a rich man for poverty, for in proportion to their numbers more rich men are ruined and fewer poor men become rich. Let us choose our pupil among the rich; we will at least be sure to have made one more man, whereas the poor can become men on their own.&quot; - Rousseau, Emile.</div>

      <div>One of the least attractive aspects of the act of suicide is its pomposity. It can give even the most banal causes a terrible gravitas. After all, suicide has only one level - and yet is invoked for many reasons; and it tends to level the gravity of all these causes. Thus the young boy who hangs himself because his teenage crush has rejected him, or the hothoused adolescent who has failed an exam would put themselves on a par with Jan Palach. [Gloss JP?] Similarly, a slap in the face delivered by a woman gives her a not-necessarily earned moral high ground. The same could be said for hanging. It levels all the crimes it is meant to redress. Just look at the sentences meted out after the Holocaust. Capital punishment has the pomposity of suggesting redress. Locking people up at least has the honesty of a makeshift arrangement. Until we understand something.</div>

      <div>The word &apos;singleton&apos; is quickly acquiring the same overtones of &apos;spinster&apos;. Its euphonic similarity to &apos;simpleton&apos; probably helps. Feminisation of culture. Whereas the sex-and-the-single girl generation turned female single to equal bachelor... Now, in a climate where, backlash, essentialism and cultural triumph are difficult to disentangle, feminisation means that &apos;singleton&apos; both male and female is becoming equated with spinster. Whereas first-wave feminism aspired to male qualities, the triumphant or resigned second wave sought to re-embrace feminine qualities. The &apos;up&apos; ending is good for the comedy of consumerism - the &apos;down&apos; beginning, therefore, must be a good start. Beatrice is at the end of it all and half way through life, men and women are lost in the dark woods. Women are supposed to get all Garcia Lorca on their boyfriends.</div>

      <div>AK-K&apos;s story. I met AK-K for dinner. Her cousin, whom she hadn&apos;t spoken to for years, phones her up and asks to meet her for lunch. As children they had spent a lot of time together, holidays in Pakistan, etc. The cousin&apos;s mother, at some point, had decided that she wasn&apos;t Pakistani at all and explained away her ethnicity as Italian. Now she was dead and the cousin&apos;s father had told the children and encouraged a certain rapprochement with their ethnicity. AK-K and her family always knew but were never allowed to tell their cousins that they, too, had Pakistani parentage. It was something of a family joke. The Aunt had decided she was Italian while on holiday in Rome (an adolescent rebellion she could never let go of, like a goth who can&apos;t suddenly start wearing colours? Or vegetarians). She asked AK-K whether she&apos;s seeing anybody. AK-K said she&apos;d been seeing this guy, off-and-on, of mixed Anglo-Italian parentage. At the end of lunch, she invited AK-K to her son&apos;s baptism the following Sunday. (Fatima is a good Catholic/Muslim compromise name.).</div>

      <div>ST: She has a beautiful scarf the colour of lapis lazuli. When she&apos;s putting it round her neck, she gathers it in her hands, bunching one side of the scarf in each of her hands, then as she&apos;s putting it over her head, she lets it rest there for a while as though she&apos;s practiced in the mirror to see how a hijab would look on her. She&apos;s told me that it&apos;s not out of the question for her to wear one in the future, and she argued about it (against it) with a Bosnian imam. She also said that Asian girls, with their dark faces, look beautiful in a hijab, whereas she&apos;d &quot;look like a minger&quot;.</div>

      <div>&quot;Both of us were marked, though to very different degrees, by our romantic readings, and our first common ground was our regret - our very great regret - that we lived in a climate so obviously ill-adapted to our ideals. Just try to be romantic in such harsh light, without dusk and without fog, without windswept plains, without old, lonely, frozen gardens, without even a paving stone glistening after the storm! [We quickly discovered that we had a common idol, Baudelaire.]&quot; [bbb Tamara p26].</div>

      <div>On the train (to Newbury): A man and a woman were seated at window seats, facing each other. FJ and I needed seats and they cleared their two aisle seats for us. We sat down, started discussing things, FJ took a couple of calls. All, almost at a whisper (which you wouldn&apos;t really associate with FJ). The man whad a tabloid open in front of him showing the 200 Shiites dead from suicide bombs the previous day. The woman was reading Hello Magazine. After about five minutes the man complained that they wanted to be quiet. They left their seat. I was angry with them all day.</div>

      <div>One aspect of the Maltese language that is ripe for literary exploration is the form of the verb. Each verb has hypothetically nine forms (plus primary) but, in usage, only a few of these forms are used. This presents us with a sort of periodic table of verbal possibility, potential verbs. Another thing we could do is write a short story in English on the presumed meaning of each one. Which one to use? &quot;Qatel&quot; This is the one in the textbooks, and possesses a certain platonic quality. Tables would also be good. (This is also true of Arabic, see Haywood p151 - see especially p154, note 4.).</div>

      <div>&quot;Few can succeed in thus creating a masterpiece (Rousseau, Stendhal, Proust) but all should find it possible to preserve in some such way things which without this slight effort would be lost forever. To keep a diary, or write down one&apos;s memories at a certain age, should be a duty &apos;State-imposed&apos;; material thus accumulated would have inestimable value after three or four generations; many of the psychological and historical problems that assail humanity would be resolved. There are no memoirs, even those written by insignificant people, which do not include social and graphic details of first-rate importance.&quot;.</div>

      <div>SL insisted on giving me a book called Landscape Painted With Tea. He showed me the book and said he wanted me to have it. He did not seem especially interested in it; and, as always, I had a lot of other books I wanted to read first and knew it would take me a very long time to get round to it. I said, well I could just borrow it, knowing that he made a point of asking back for books at which point I would say, Listen, I haven&apos;t had time to read it. Here have it back then I&apos;ll ask to borrow it again when I know I&apos;ll have time to read it. This is the universal ploy used by all those who have books pressed on them. But SL made it quite clear he wanted me to keep it and that he would never ask for it back. The quirky title, Landscape Painted With Tea, had stuck in my mind but I never registered the author&apos;s name. Eight years later I checked the author&apos;s name, Milorad Pavic, a writer from Belgrade.

      <div>Whenever I had asked ST to introduce me to some Bosnian authors, she always mentioned Ivo Andric, a Nobel prizewinner. Then I saw a new edition of The Bridge Over the Drina had come out, and it had a hyperbolic recommendation from Georges Perec, who says that it surpasses A Thousand and One Nights. I met ST at Waterstones, we had not been there for some time. Our waitress, Nam Sung, said she was going to start learning TEFL. It used to be our office from office. I told ST that I had seen this new edition; she screwed up her face slightly and I understood what she meant. I said, Fine, I won&apos;t buy it. (This is a sort of affectionate game of solidarity we play.) She told me, No, no, buy it. I said, she&apos;s only saying that and that she would hold it against me. She said, no, honestly, we&apos;ll go and get it after we finish our wine. I said she would have to buy it for me and in exchange I would get her the Arabian Nights. She said that&apos;s a great idea but she&apos;ll pay cash so her mum won&apos;t be able to trace the purchase. I mentioned Perec&apos;s endorsement she said, Yes, the French have always loved the Serbs. When we went to get it, the Arabian Nights (Burton) was twice as expensive as the Andric and ST said it&apos;s not a fair exchange. I said the Andric was much more expensive for her and she joked, Yes, I&apos;m paying with my soul but it&apos;s part of the healing.</div>

      <div>Religious societies, and religious people, are rarely &apos;better&apos; people than secular ones. Indeed, they are often worse. Seularism is less sophisticated than religion - in the good and the bad sense. It is less sophistic which often leads to inane, playground-level discourse but is less prone to balloooning into atrocity. But it is also less sophisticated in that it has less refined mechanisms with which to regulate itself. Secularism has no difficulty in generating good. The one mechanism that secularism often lacks is the regulation of too much good. Excessive displays of piety are frequently frowned upon in many religious societies. Not so in the secular world. Many vegetarians seem to have acquired their conviction simply to enter into long explanations with waiters on the Continent that chickens don&apos;t grow on trees. [cf. Corinthians on eating what is offered.].</div>

      <div>My Mother and Mr Berlusconi. She used to watch South American soap operas dubbed into, Italian, a language she did not understand. This private channel showed an episode each of several different soap operas, and the fact that they were all dubbed by the same agency, employing the same set of actors, the fact that all the actors had had their physiognomy modified by a limited set of celebrity clinics according to the same principles of contemporary cosmetic phrenology and the limited permutations of the genre, meant that even to someone who uinderstood the language, there was a certain overwhelming uniformity. She would sit in front of the TV, dozing off now and then, and formed in her mind a vast, oneiric saga, spanning various centuries of South American settings, from the Haciendas of the 18th Century to the penthouses of the 20th, from the pampas to the barrios. The same former prizewinning beauties enacted the same melodramas of illicit loves, untimely pregnancies and irresistible passions.</div>

      <div>&quot;Dejjen&quot; is a very good use of the forms of the verb, meaning he lent someone money - put someone in his debt.

      <div>In Malta you see many flags on private houses. Dotted here and there you see flags flying half mast, sometimes you see a row of flags in the same street (possibly the owners are in compettion - it&apos;s obviously very difficult to resist the phallic possibilities of one-upmanship). Sometimes, then, you see a row of these flags but only one of them is flying half mast - a publicised private grief.</div>

      <div>The Passion of the Christ is like a paegant, there is zero interpretation, zero art, it is a devotional work - but not as uncompromising as it pretends to be. The infamous &quot;Let his blood be upon us and upon our children,&quot; is omitted. Also, the only bit which is stylised is the Resurrection, the one part which non-believers would find hard to swallow. In what is otherwise a very graphic film, this is the only ambiguous part. Strangely, the violence is quite overwhelming but it is only really a reiteration of a very familiar iconography - except now done in the hyper-realism of contemporary action cinema. Mel Gibson has probably managed to emancipate a medium for devotional purposes. And by medium here I don&apos;t mean film but specifically Hollywood film. The film is very much about the physical suffering of Christ. The story of the passion is also very much about this - no matter what the symbolism can stand for - i.e. The signified may well be complex but the signifier is the blood and gore. The blood and gore are very much there, though they may well go beyond catharsis. It is artistically interesting that the film provides state-of-the-art catharsis. If it fails in this, it&apos;s in the fact that the human suffering - betrayal, etc - which is certainly an important part of Christ&apos;s suffering cannot be depicted in such a blunt film.</div>

      <div>Karmnu &apos;l-Mesmerun: He became ill and always felt as though he were falling. He would buy watches, become obsessed that they were &apos;losing&apos; time. He always sold his watches at a loss, swapped them for inferior models, etc. People - other watch dealers but not, of course, my dad - would exploit him. His life was, at once, an homage and a desperate insult to time, always selling it short. Every morning he would go to the archpriest who would give him 50c to buy cigarettes. When he became bedridden, he had a last watch, he knew his time was up, he asked my father to sell it for him. For the first time ever he just wanted to sell a watch, rather than swap it or trade it in. My father sold it for him, to his brother. Both Karmnu and my uncle died within a month of each other. My uncle&apos;s wife gave the watch to my father. (Ironically, all I had to do was tell my father how much I liked it and he said, &quot;Have it&quot;. He is always impatient to get rid of things.).</div>

      <div>There&apos;s a woman who is always at Tesco reading gossip magazines late in the evening, without ever seeming to buy any, as though she were looking for a particular mention. Whatever time of year, she always wears grey tracksuit bottoms, which are quite sexy really because they seem to just about cling to her bottom. These give the impression that she was lounging around at home and has just popped out. Sometimes she just wears a T-shirt with them, sometimes a pin-stripe jacket. She always wears trainers. She looks about cagily. She is fairly pretty, blonde, unsmiling with too much make-up. Like a former celebrity in a Witness Protection Scheme or an inadequately reformed gossip-holic.</div>

      <div>Hip-hop translates amazingly well. Especially considering that you would have thought that the ethnicity of the original is very deeply encoded. What does it contain that is universal and so translatable? Is it a priori universal or a posteriori (following its worldwide success)? Does this a posteriori universality also apply to translations from a dominant language? I think, musically, it works so well because it adapts itself to the language, deconstructing its syllabic structure.</div>

      <div>P78: he could not support disaster. This sounds as though badly translated from Maltese. It makes no sense in English and would [only] makes sense if &apos;support&apos; is understood as &apos;jissaporti&apos;, a faux ami for &apos;to suffer&apos;. In Mid-90s I used to get the feeling that Russian&gt;&gt;English sounds like Maltese&gt;&gt;English. Then learnt about the Al-Himjar hypothesis and the Slavic element. Hm - I think it has more to do with some concealed process of normalisation.</div>

      <div>With images, we seem to be able to reconstruct the phenomena in our mind, when we imagine them. The word imagine, of course, offers an etymological hint. Sometimes, we manage to do it with sound, mostly our own name being called, involuntarily, or when we&apos;re about to go to sleep. Whenever our mind performs an equivalent reconstruction for any of our other senses, we call it hallucination.</div>

      <div>There&apos;s a frequently undocumented streak of Anglophilia running through French Culture. The writers of the Oulipo - Jacques Roubaud especially - are pretty keen about English-language literature. Which is odd because their own writing is, and the philosophy behind it, is most alien to England. Often, in fact, English translations of their work are only available from US punblishers. (US Anglophilia, though very old, is another frequently unremarked phenomenon, especially of late.).</div>

      <div>Magic realism is the literary equivalent of hip-hop. Does it tap into a universality - and what is that universality? Is it the acceptable face of Orientalism-all-over-again? How can a form be relevant to both Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Salman Rushdie? (And here we are mentioning two bona fide geniuses of the mode - not to be held responsible for all the sub-Marquezes and sub-Rushdies we (and literary editors, poor souls) have had to endure. Obviously, there is a filtering mechanism at work, determining the works that are translated into English - the ones that flatter our cosmopolitanness and our preconceptions, and the ones that are subsequently lionised. This perpetuates the myth that beyond Anglo-Saxon culture lies merely the irrational hinterland. It used to be attacked - now it is praised and remunerated. But it is still owned and defined.</div>

      <div>Jacques Roubaud says that dreams are only an affectation of the waking. [the awake|the waking hours] His reasons are obvious, they cannot be proven, they are always a tale told by people when they are awake. [talk, Institut Francais 12.05.2004] I tend to agree with him, personally I am with those who do not believe in the hypnotic state. He goes on to add, and perhaps he is taking his turn at affectation, that he does not dream - and has had only one dream in his life: coming out of the tube, girl with red hair [hat?] ... He would write a novel called The Great Fire of London. This is the foundation myth of his great unwritten novel, Le grande incende de Londre (Publisher, 19xx). When someone mentions the Oulipians to him, he dissociates himself slightly and says, &quot;They dream.&quot;.</div>

      <div>Jacques Roubaud was asked: &quot;In England there is a great resistance to the idea of the intellectual, whereas in France they are revered. Do you find that?&quot; (The man asking the question was English and looked like he could plausibly lay claim to being one of the unloved intellectuals.) ROubaud answered that, no he has never felt it but seemed quite comfortable with being called an intellectual. An English intellectual sans la lettre would have pretended to be unaffected by the question as he would not want to be mistaken for an intellectual.</div>

      <div>IMPORTANT: suggest that this is exactly what Wutz was doing: his books ended up being anagrams of the &apos;original&apos; since 1) He knew, from the catalogue, the length of each book. 2) Due to the consistency of letter frequency distribution within the same language, the two texts would effectively be anagrams of each other.</div>

      <div>In this sense, a translation is a text in one language restricted by a text in another. On restrictions. On translation as a Oulipian restriction. What makes one shy away from restriction is the taboo of using the wrong word just for effect - contingency. Ironically, my taboo for precision comes with the admonition of another Oulipian, Italo Calvino. Then again, that is probably to miss the point for the right word surely is the one that comes from the scheme.</div>

      <div>The restriction is by definition, arbitrary but if it is to make any sense it must be justified and consistent. The justification is, in many ways, self-fulfilling since the only thing that there will be to justify about the resultant text will be the restriction itself - because the text is the restriction. But there is also a penumbra of possibility around the restriction. Having decided to use only the letters of the original German text, various decisions immediately become necessary.</div>

      <div>The nature of letter distribution is such that two texts of substantial (and identical) length in the same language will contain similar patterns of distribution for each letter. The longer the texts, obviously due to the law of averages, the closer their patterns will be. There will be, in two English-language texts, a frequent occurrence of the letter e, followed by the other vowels and so on up to the most unpopular consonants. When comparing two texts of identical length but in a different language, the pattern of distribution is likely to vary. This is what gives the texture of each language its overall character, just as any pattern made up of various discrete elements, be it a mosaic or a kaleidoscope will still possess certain elements which stand out. Even the most uniform of beaches has its own grains, the regular dotting of which gives the beach its unique character. We may think of this as a template of distribution. The fact that we are working from one pattern to another is what gives this project such value as it may possess. It is the deliberate utterance of one language in the template of another, much like the familiar comic routine of singing the lyrics of one song to the tune of another. Happily for my project, the two languages share a near-identical alphabet. The fact that one language can be anagrammatised in another surely says something about their relationship. German and English are linguistic sisters [siblings], there are no letters in German that cannot be efficiently expressed in English, as would be the case with the French accents, for instance [quote them here if we need to get rid of them]. Even though this piece of writing would work better in French. </div>

      <div>However, there are a few anomalies that will need to be worked out. The first is not really an anomaly at all but rather something that simply has to be decided upon. This is the nature of spaces. White space is obviously a large component of the page, covering - in a normal page of text - up to 95% of it. It will become immediately obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a few moments that much of the printer&apos;s art goes into the management of this white space, in fact most of the printer&apos;s decisions involve margins, borders, gutters, ladding, tracking, ligatures - all of them concerned with bringing this white space under control, creating a channel through which the text can flow. In a well laid-out page, any printer and typesetter will tell you, this needs to be of such uniformity that it does not distract the &apos;harmonic gait&apos; of the act of reading. Rivers of white space trickling down the page are avoided in printing done according to the craft such that an even &apos;greyness&apos; of a page is achieved. [This relates to the overall pattern of the language, as discussed above re sandy beach - the notion of greyness should be discussed before the beach so that the other one makes sense.] Different texts and different languages will obviously have a different greyness, a different shade.</div>

      <div>It is also something of a truism to say that the white space is the negative image of our text. Our two anagrammatised texts displace the same amount of white space, they have the same density [find the precise term in physics re flotation of ships]. In very real terms they are using the same (measurable) volume of ink , covering the same acreage. (Here we can become as interested in this as someone applying gold-leaf for whom such calculations would have very pragmatic consequences. Are there less utterances in German inscribed in gold leaf?) The relationship between our two texts is therefore thus: they are the same amount of matter differently formed, reshaped clay.</div>

      <div>Zooming out our gaze, we come to our first decision. There are special spaces which are not quite the same as the rest of the white space on the page. These are the spaces between words. These spaces do not merely possess spatial qualities, as the other white space does. These spaces are notational, as notational as the letters themselves since they determine the words. Although a language system without spaces is conceivable - indeed the use of spaces is a relatively recent introduction - they constitute a part of both our source and our target languages here. Jewish mystics contemplating on language - specifically the somehow noumenal language (oxymoron) of the Torah - saw each space thus and gave it the same dignity as the letter, that is, that each space - as with each letter - is unique, not merely interchangeable. In this sense, the Torah has no alphabet since it does not merely constitute the varied iteration of 22 letters (and one space) but a long sequence of ink-marks (one can hardly call them letters when deprived of equivalence) which are phenomenally identical but noumenally distinct. (In Kabbalistic numerology - gematria - letters do not merely have a fixed value, it depends on where the letter is.) Mystical contemplation of the Torah did contemplate an alphabet, but an alphabet that is  as long as the Torah itself - and the written Torah is merely one arrangement of this thousands of letters-long alphabet.</div>

      <div>It is important  here to digress on the Torah. It is hard to begin to talk about letters with any sort of obsession without digressing into mentions of the Torah, since Jewish mystics have done so much work on that field and since their name is invoked so readily when contemplating words, letters and texts. It is therefore apropos to mention them here, if only to define precisely how our project differs from such meditations. We are, first and foremost, relying on the principle of equivalence, that our alphabet constitutes less than thirty letters, that there is some sense in treating these letters as equivalent. We may, however, borrow some of their speculations in assuming that by rearranging the letters we have also rearranged noumenal reality, that if letters possess qualities, or even &apos;meaning&apos; that is not simply derived from their friction, butting up with, adjacent letters, then we have another level of rearrangement; that if each letter has its own valency which is satisfied or frustrated by its combination with other letters, then by transposing them to a new arrangement (and a new language) we are setting up a new narrative of fulfilment. We have not therefore only created new circuits of meaning (we have to find some other word) by creating new phonemes out of the letters, we have also changed the dynamic presence of each component. [not clear enough]</div>

      <div>We must, therefore, precisely define our restriction, qualify our restriction, restrict our restriction. Our restriction licenses us to use the letters from one text to form another text. We have speculated that the space can plausibly be considered as legitimate a letter as &apos;a&apos; or &apos;b&apos; since it has a very real  orthographic value. But the space also has another function which distinguishes it from other letters: it delineates words, legislates words (what&apos;s the exact term used by land/borders treaties). To use the same amount of spaces in our target text would also be to use the same number of words, and here we would be extending our licence, we would be changing the graininess, the resolution of our anagram. If rearranging the letters would be an atomic reshuffle, then rearranging the words would be molecular (although this is merely a model - seeing words as atoms and letters as sub-atomic makes some sense - let us say our letters are atoms in a 19th Century sense, apparently indivisible - divisible only by some trauma).</div>

Such a restriction would give us a text with the same number of letters and the same number of words - but the words themselves would be different. That is it would not be the same as if we were rearranging the words (which, across, languages would be impossible).</div>

      <div>There is, of course, a scale of restriction, going from the strictest to the most tolerant - up to the most tolerant of all: no restriction at all - a hypothetical case since language itself is a restriction.

      <div>To retain the same number of spaces, would, therefore be to retain the same number of words, this introduces another restriction and, in one sense, nullifies our previous restriction. There is a certain element of arbitrary justification going on here, to be sure. Or rather, this introduces an unwanted feature into our restriction - our real restriction will have brought in a phantom restriction - which is a &apos;quality&apos;of the restriction rather than a restriction per se. [But still not sure whether to keep them in or not - same for punctuation - depends on result, really. Also, paragraphing is doing the same thing - in fact it&apos;s imposing the structure of the original.]</div>

      <div>By eliminating the consideration of spaces, we still retain the identical volume of our two texts. So far we have only sacrificed the mystical specialness of the spaces within words. Our two texts are still consuming the same amount of ink running through differently formed channels. We now have to approach a second decision, since it is evident that the ink-marks of the original text, do not only form letters - they also form punctuation marks. Punctuation marks legislate parts of sentences in much the same way that spaces legislate words. If we were to retain the punctuation marks, we would have the same number of sentences in both texts, and the same number of branchings, periods, parentheses in both texts. As with two cities with the same number of streets, curves, junctions, hump-back bridges and cross-roads but differently arranged. Like an extensive train set which allows a child to reconfigure the same pieces of track in various ways. This is attractive for two reasons, one far more venial than the other. Firstly, much in the spirit of our translation, it will cause a very desirable distortion of the target language. This is very much akin to the distortion of using a German letter-quantity template on to the English language. The cadences of the sentences, their length and number will be a repackaging of English words into German units of measurement. As though a German architect had been assigned - as they often are - to rebuild a London square. As though English beer were being sold in litres or steins. (How about that disquisition on 568ml of milk, rather than a pint - where the bottle becomes a description of the measurement - or is it vice versa.) Another element of distortion would be introduced by the altered nuances of the punctuation. Does a semi-colon have the same effect on the flow of a German sentence as it does on an English one? Is its judicious use equally &quot;a barometer of civilisation&quot;? [The second reason that retaining the same punctuation marks would be attractive is more pragmatic, since it is actually not a very onerous restriction. NOT TRUE.]</div>

      <div>Were we working from another source language this consideration would not take on the prominence that it must for us here, and it would be merely a continuation of the above. Apart from proper nouns, capital letters in most European languages are used only to indicate the beginning of a sentence. This is a mere flourish; it has no syntagmatic value since the beginning of a sentence is really denoted by the fact that it begins the sentence after the previous one has been terminated by a period mark . If, therefore, we had chosen to use the same punctuation, we would automatically be using the same number of capital letters since every full stop would be followed by one.</div>

      <div>Our only consideration, then, would have been whether to retain the remaining capital letters, the ones denoting proper nouns. But the German language has retained the use of capital letters for all its nouns, whereas English only retains them for proper nouns. Indeed, this is one of the most distinctive features when the text is &apos;seen&apos; rather than read . As a philosophical question, this is a question of a lower order since the distinction between what is a proper noun and what is a common noun is in reality a trivial one. Each noun, be it proper or not, is the name for the thing we are mentioning . Adam, mysteriously, gave each animal a name &apos;each according to their own&apos;. There used to be a time when capital letters were used in English. A look at Gulliver&apos;s Travels, for instance will show us [ideally find a quotation which is apropos] that &quot;I had made many Circomlocutions in describing to him the Nature of the several crimes , for which most of our Crew had been forced to fly their Country&quot; . However, the only way to accommodate this surfeit of capital letters (count them, count averages) into an unaffected English translation would be, either to use a disproportionate amount of proper nouns or to have many more sentences in the opening of which we could accommodate them. This would lead to an unacceptable distortion of our target language, introducing false quantities in our diction. It would result in an unfaithful translation.</div>

      <div>By deciding not to retain the same number of capital letters, we bid farewell to any hope of equivalent surface area.

      <div>Had we decided to retain the same amount of capital letters, our materialist equivalency would have here reached an almost impassable test. German has retained the ß. Once again, this is merely a convention since it is seen as equivalent to &apos;ss&apos;, as confirmed by the spelling reform. The Swiss have always spelt it so. Now that we have abandoned our materialist basis, we can quite comfortably decide to replace each instance of ß with &apos;ss&apos;. This is a classic piece of casuistry, defend the defensible to pre-empt the indefensible . It will also mean, of course, that our target text will have more letters (count them). We will also have a certain anomaly that some of the &apos;s&apos;s in our target texts will be genuine materialist equivalents while others will be separated twins [what was that Greek term for split creatures? (split hermaphrodites)] with a frustrated valency. One solution would be to have as many &apos;ss&apos; in the target text as there are in the original. (False quantity?).</div>

      <div>Our next decision extends the domain of our project. German retains the diacritical umlaut. These umlauts are almost emblematic and, although not used exclusively in German, almost immediately evoke to the non-German Teutonic associations: severity, precision, etc. Our decision will be whether, for instance to interpret &apos;ü&apos; as &apos;u&apos; or as &apos;ue&apos;. [diphtongs] The effect of the umlaut is, in pronunciation, to add an e after the vowel, softening it, nudging it. In German to English loanwords the fate of this e is arbitrary, so there is no convention. It will be useless to turn to any kabbalistic meditations on this topic since Semitic languages treat all vowels as trivial, mere facilitators of pronunciation. The result of our decision would be quite dramatic, of course. Deciding to add an e after each vowel with an umlaut would greatly increase the number of letters in our target text, and exacerbate the disparity between the letters. What, then, is the honest equivalent of &apos;ü&apos; in an alphabet that does not use umlauts? Since we are working with established languages, and languages are contracts of sorts, conventions, it would also be useful to see what conventions exist for traffic between the two languages. When a word is borrowed from the German into English, the umlauted vowel is rendered quite haphazardly, either into a solitary &apos;u&apos; as in --- or as &apos;ue&apos; (&apos;---&apos;). Since it is acceptable, in German spelling, to expand umlauted vowels to the vowel followed by an &apos;e&apos;, the most faithful rendition would be to treat an umlaut as an extra &apos;e&apos;.</div>

      <div>Whenever art borrows from another discipline (especially science): although it should have full license to do so, and as playfully as it wants; it should also be prepared to answer to any objection raised by that discipline. This legitimises the borrowing. E.g. Frayn&apos;s Copenhagen borrows the idea of the Uncertainty Principle, but only insofar as to say &quot;we are uncertain as to what happened.&quot; [TRACE: confirm] The Uncertainty principle is far more complex than that. It states that there are certain pairs of properties which cannoth both be known with accuracy. Velocity and position of a sub-atomic particle, for instance. This is a far more interesting idea and would have led to an enrichment of what is already an excellent work.</div>

      <div>&quot;Even the most beautiful and valuable writings, when their own author is reciting them, become such as to kill with boredom. In this connection a philologist friend of mine has observed that if it is true that Octavia fainted when she heard Virgil read the sixth book of the Aeneid, we may well believe that that happened, not so much because she was reminded of her son Marcellus, as they say, as through boredom on hearing the reading.&quot;.</div>

      <div>Selma, city, seat (1865) of Dallas county, central Alabama, U.S., on the Alabama River. Settled in 1815 as Moore&apos;s Bluff or Landing, it was renamed at its incorporation (1820) from Ossian&apos;s poem &quot;The Song of Selma.&quot; A Confederate supply depot during the American Civil War, it was burned by Union troops after a battle on its outskirts (April 2, 1865). In 1965 it was the centre of a black voter-registration drive led by Martin Luther King, Jr. Local violence against civil-rights activists, culminating in the murder of James J. Reeb, a Boston clergyman, led to a massive, nonviolent protest march from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital.
Located in a dairy, livestock, grain, soybean, and cotton region, Selma now supports diversified industries. The city is the seat of Selma University (1878). Pop. (1993 est.) 24,646.

      <div>Paul Vehvilainen worked from Propp&apos;s model to create a symplified system that merges several functions, to arrive at an abbreviated list of five functions which, like Propp&apos;s, always occur in the same sequence:
1. There is a LACK of something.
2. This forces the hero to go on a QUEST to eliminate the lack.
3. On the quest, the hero encounters a MAGICAL HELPER.
4. (S)he is subjected to one or more TESTS.
This may be divided into two: an initial, qualifying test necessary to secure the helpers&apos; help, and additional tests related to the quest itself.
5. After passing the test, (s)he achieves his/her REWARD.</div>

      <div>TRACE: Scriblerus, omniscientist ... Who had read every book (parody). &quot;18th-century British literary club whose founding members were the brilliant Tory wits Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, Thomas Parnell, and John Arbuthnot. Its purpose was to ridicule pretentious erudition and scholarly jargon through the person of a fictitious literary hack, Martinus Scriblerus (Martin suggesting Swift, Scriblerus meaning a writer). The collaboration of the five writers on the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus began as early as 1713 and led to frequent, spirited meetings when they were all in London. When they were separated, they pursued their project through correspondence. The zest, energy, and time that these five highly individualistic talents put into their joint enterprise may be gauged by Pope&apos;s statement in a letter to Swift, &quot;The top of my own ambition is to contribute to that great work [the Memoirs], and I shall translate Homer by the by.&quot; Of the five, only Pope and Swift lived to see the publication of the Memoirs (1741), although miscellaneous minor pieces written in collaboration or individually had appeared earlier under the Scriblerus name. Although Pope is credited with originating the character of Scriblerus, most of the ideas were Arbuthnot&apos;s, and he was the most industrious of the collaborators. The stimulation the members derived from each other had far-reaching effects. Gay&apos;s The Beggar&apos;s Opera grew out of a suggestion made by Swift to the Scriblerus Club, and the imprint of Scriblerus on Swift&apos;s Gulliver&apos;s Travels, especially Book III, describing the voyage to Laputa, is unmistakable. Other prominent Tories--such as Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke--were members of the club, but there is no evidence that they contributed to the writing.&quot;.</div>

Few books which many read produce middlebrow blockbusters. Many books which many read lead to inanity.</div>

      <div>TRACE in LRB quote &quot;Who would write who can do anything else?&quot;] The compulsion to write is, in any case, a mysterious one. Borges claimed he was prouder of what he had read, than of what he had written. That, of course, like Benjamin&apos;s sophisticated utterances was easy for him to say. In order to write, one needs a conviction of inevitability. That what one writes, needs to be written - let alone read [by others]. Even Johnson&apos;s pecuniary imperative rings as hollow affectation, as Boswell, part-scandalised, part-condescending his subject, rightly notes. There are easier, more pleasurable and less uncertain ways to earn a living. The other ostensible motivation - &apos;Because I am otherwise unemployable&apos; - is also a gross affectation. If Goethe could work as a diplomat, Shakespeare as an actor, Dante as a schemer, Chekhov as a doctor, Chaucer as a, Sterne as a, Levi as a, Eliot as a, Kafka as a, etc. Even though publishers fashionably stack their writers&apos; biographical blurb with spoof jobs - chicken rouster in Malaysia [get some actual ones] - as if to reassure the reader about the fatal inevitability [taut.] of the writer&apos;s vocation because surely no one was put on this earth to roust chickens in Malaysia. That this writer did not simply take up the pen one day, but that there was a Marxian-Hegelian inevitability (In fact, it is in the world of vanity publishing that the writer&apos;s useful day job is emphasised, as if to justify the author&apos;s having no time to enter the world of legitimate publishing.) [what is this &apos;rousting&apos;?]. RIPE.</div>

      <div>It occurred to me the other day that I used to have what is frequently called a &apos;style&apos;. It had certain aspects, first of all it was very distinctive and I was always proud of the fact that you could pick out any sentence and it would still be recognisably mine. It mixed archaic and pop-references and had a rethorical pop rhythm. It worked best with rants (jeremiads?) but was useless for anything more nuanced. Magazine editors liked it because it was distinctive and immediate. But I was tired of it, I knew it could never really work as a voice for fiction. Ironically, though, I created it for I Come Quickly, a novel whose very title embodies pop and archaic; it&apos;s a quotation from the KJV. It was very tight and could be precise though I was quite prone to pleonasm. The rhythms also tended to be quite repetitive - a form of doggerel in prose. I was also incapable of writing anything not in that style, which made it quite difficult to write anything as simple as a postcard.</div>

      <div>Is there anything I want to retain from this old style? Possibly the tightness. The rethorical aspects were good but they were then leavened by the demotic nature of my writing. Since I would like to lose that demotic - or rather - transform it to a less forced one, the rethoric in my new style will need something else to leaven it.</div>

      <div>Perhaps the most pernicious quality of Empire is not its propensity to homogenise but rather its propensity to encourage and incentivise the Other to fulfil its notions of it. Thus regions come to re-imagine themselves as the unique and Other places. Admittedly, this is only a compressed, short-circuited, form of that process that forms a culture in the first place. When one&apos;s identity itself becomes a commodity, then the rules of consumerism kick in: differentiation, accesibility. The final phase is Self-Orientalism. Cf. Baudrillard Perfect Crime, and, of course, Said: Orientalism.</div>

A friend tries to persuade him that God is not some mafia hoodlum who would kill someone else by mistake. His friend was taller.

      <div>EG&apos;s story: She was in Gozo, the police called at home. They asked, &quot;Does EG live here? Does she have short hair?&quot; My father was there and he was very worried but they wouldn&apos;t tell him what it&apos;s about. They said, &quot;Don&apos;t tell her, let her enjoy herself, we will come tomorrow.&quot; My father kept thinking what it could be about. At 4 in the morning he remembered it could be about Philip the hairdresser, who had been arrested for being a &quot;benefit cheat&quot; Next morning, when she returned, she got dressed up and waited for them. Unlike my father she did ask them for an ID (two men and one woman). They told her that, yes, it was about Philip. They had had a report, staked out the house and saw her entering from the &quot;business&quot; door. They waited for her to leave (&quot;You don&apos;t half chat&quot; they told her) and followed her home. On their description they put her down as 55 but they were surprised, when they looked her up in the electoral register, that she is 66.</div>

      <div>&quot;Apparently, no one bothered to check out the envelope until 1981, when a former Trappist monk went berserk and hijacked a plane, demanding that the Vatican release the Third Secret or else he would blow up the plane and its 100 plus passengers. The Vatican did no such thing, and an armed takeover of the plane ended the crisis. Turns out former Trappist monks aren&apos;t very effective against commandos.&quot; - http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/marian-apparitions/.</div>

      <div>Verissimo seems to miss the point of the Orang-utan. Several times he makes reference to the mediocrity of the work produced by such an ape. The point of the pangram is that it obliterates all notions of style, plausibility, and authorship. People frequently miss the point, they say &quot;a monkey typing at random&quot; Randomness is no guarantee of exhaustiveness. Indeed this is an important point that separates this idea from the idea of eternal recurrence. The eternal Orang-Utan can easily get caught in a loop - though in a context of eternity, since all books are equally likely to recur, this would be improbable. ESSAY. And in any case, the infinite library would also contain an infinite amount exegesis and lit erary criticism that would establish new aesthetics that would &apos;dignify&apos; the &apos;mediocre&apos; pieces.</div>

      <div>&quot;The measure is English heroic verse without rime, as that of Homer in Greek, and of Virgil in Latin-rime being no necessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse, in longer works especially, but the invention of a barbarous age, to set off wretched matter and lame metre; graced indeed since by the use of some famous modern poets, carried away by custom, but much to their own vexation, hindrance, and constraint to express many things otherwise, and for the most part worse, than else they would have expressed them. Not without cause therefore some both Italian and Spanish poets of prime note have rejected rime both in longer and shorter works, as have also long since our best English tragedies, as a thing of itself, to all judicious ears, trivial and of no true musical delight; which consists only in apt numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another, not in the jingling sound of like endings-a fault avoided by the learned ancients both in poetry and all good oratory. This neglect then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect, though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers, that it rather is to be esteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of riming.&quot; - John Milton, Paradise Lost (foreword).</div>

Flaubert&apos;s famous letter to George Sand:
&quot;When I come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences, I&apos;m sure I&apos;m floundering in the false. By searching I find the proper expression, which was always the only one, and which is also harmonious. The word is never lacking when one possesses the idea. Is there not, in this precise fitting of parts, something eternal, like a principle? If not, why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word? Or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry?&quot;.</div>

      <div>This is the first instance of imagining Wutz visually - obviously imagining how the illustrator imagined Wutz. So: imagine picture to imagine words. Or imagine another image pressed into service by the designer to help us imagine Wutz, something vaguely relevant to the theme. Perhaps The Wanderer and his shadow, a clichï¿½d image for a book cover.</div>

      <div>Where do we put this? His mind dictates the great works of literature, curious folios. Maybe he had a secretary, his wife - would Wutz be married? His sister, perhaps. But somehow this spoils the image of solitary strife. For Wutz&apos;s project, seemed to me, to require an inner life unhampered by the constant checks and accounting of a shared domestic arrangement. Perhaps his wife or sister or secretary was too enthralled by the pontificating schoolmaster to question his activities. Perhaps she was a simple woman. Or, on the contrary, perhaps she humoured his wishes, seeing it as an odd but harmless pastime. Better to let him retire to his manuscripts than to be the oral recipient of his inventive energy.</div>

      <div>Sure enough, he could talk about a great deal of subjects but their nature was so far removed from the daily comings and goings of the little town that the conversation would quite naturally drift towards their provenance. He had never really thought about his process until he started preparing an account of it for his dinner guests. How can he explain how he imagines the content of the book? Wutz makes little attempt to think in abstract terms, about arguments, narratives, plots and characters. He sees the words, he sees the ink staining the paper, he sees them as if he were holding the book up close, a few centimetres from his eyes so that he can see the grain of the paper. It took Wutz some years to refine his process. On the blank paper of his mind, the rumours of books sparked images of words, of the imagined books, their various paper stock and bindings, leather and stitching. His mind edged in from the blankness of the paper to the edges of the letters, the tentative darkness of the ink, the nearly imperceptible penumbra of diffuse ink, blotted over time by the paper. As he dared to pull back, Wutz would see whole letters, then words, then streams of words, pages, chapters. But as he sketched what he saw, as his mind interpreted those ink marks they provoked other images which he struggled to take down. Wutz always sought, but never really found, a single process. Not that he wanted to limit his possibilities, to restrain his imagination. He wanted to enlarge his libraries, he wanted new volumes on his shelf and could only do this by choosing which images to take down and which to ignore. The rumours of books he read of were, after all, short circuits, tips of proven routes, directions, rumours of the existence of a route [invoke rumours of lands, paths, etc] which has been navigated, like rumours of the Southern Lands, viable combinations of words in the sea of combinatorial possibilities of his imagination.</div>

How long would it last? Am I far enough from it? Five or six metres - is that enough? It has bags dangling from the handles - how much explosive could they contain. The people who just got up from the table seemed Brazilian, maybe Colombian. Not exactly famous for international terrorism. Maybe cartels... News of a Kidnapping. Why would they globalise? Is that the nature of any organisation? Why here?</div>

      <div>Here we&apos;re invoking the idea of a rumour of a book as the rumour of a distant land.] The title and the physical description of the book would sit in Wutz&apos;s mind for some days. &quot;...Without place or date, but with a shield upon the last leaf, with a monogram composed of the letters H. P. R., and surmounted by an eagle. Small folio, oblong, the form of an account book, with 47 leaves, not numbered; old calf binding, much used.&quot; Like a clue for a riddle. Surely, given so many details, he could come to the book, surely there could only be one book that satisfies so many criteria. He would try to hold that image in his mind for as long as possible and then start describing it. The details served as filters, determining which sentences, say, belonged in a book monogrammed, &quot;H.P.R.&quot;, and which did not. In Wutz&apos;s time, the title of books still acted as a synopsis of what the reader could expect. Although it would have been of no advantage to the author had every reader extrapolated from the title as much as Wutz did, it was precisely this process of imagining the book and deciding whether such a book was desirable. The process remains even with the terser modern title, of course. Even seeing a book called &quot;G&quot; or &quot;W&quot; propels us to do this. In fact, the shorter and more cryptical the title is, the more we are tempted to preconstruct the book in our heads. The title of the book and the few anecdotal details would create another image in Wutz&apos;s mind - a more abstract one perhaps.</div>

      <div>The Oulipian clinamen has one important condition: it must be willed, i.e. The writer should have the orthodox alternative up his sleeve. For Wutz, it might be good to do a &apos;w&apos; instead of another letter in an instance where the letter with the &apos;w&apos; is an obvious pun on the word which would have completed the scheme. The reader should more or less expect it because of the context where we&apos;re discussing the &apos;w&apos; but the clinamen itself should probably remain unmentioned.</div>

      <div>Now Benjamin tends to give the impression of being a rather well-read man. So when he says he has hardly read any of his books he is either being coy, or he is dissembling, or he had a separate library which he has at least leafed through, or his reading days were behind him, or he was in the habit of borrowing books, or this library he was now unpacking was so vast that even the tiniest fraction of it would suffice to educate a man, or he was in the habit of buying books, reading them gingerly, making sure he doesn&apos;t distress the binding or spill coffee on the pages, and then returning them to the shop.</div>

      <div>The watch has the word &quot;Automatic&quot; running below the centre. This has been replaced by the meaningless &quot;Kinetic&quot; - it could just as well have been termed &quot;Potential&quot;. &quot;Automatic&quot; beautifully suggests by-product and economy. When my father gave me the watch he advised me that, should I not wear it for a few days, and find it has stopped, I should &quot;give the watch a shake&quot; I remember this advice being repeated to customers and my brothers would always give a silly snort. Reviving the watch does involve shaking, or rather, clutching it between thumb and index finger and shaking it gently, the index finger is tickled as the centripetal pressure of the half-wheel, a half-moon of metal, passes it.</div>

      <div>Although I was delighted with this anecdote, the first thing I could think of was, Why was the author&apos;s name hyphenated here? Like Moby-Dick, perhaps, the German writer gains and loses his hyphen as he tosses on the waves of reference. Incidentally, Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the reason why he chose Jean as his name so perhaps Bénabou&apos;s hyphenations is a somewhat heavy-handed homage.</div>

      <div>In an interview (BBC Radio4, front row, 19.10.2004) Dom Jolie said he did a prank in which a set of traffic lights were set up in the middle of nowhere and set to red - and people were stopping and waiting. This, he said, is &quot;very english - we wait and queue politely&quot; I saw the very same prank on Italian TV about 15 years ago. The man (Pupo, a baby-faced pop star) stopped and waited for half an hour in the middle of a snow-packed mountain road. No doubt, an English observer would have put this down to Continental predilection to following orders - just one click of the heels short of goosestepping.</div>

It wwas removed and he made a full recovery. It is very rare that lung cancer is detected early enough. We agreed it was a miracle.</div>

      <div>By some geological oversight, the soil that surrounded the house was hard and not at all absorbent, a rare thing in the fertile valleys of Auenthal. [this is the idyll] It thus failed to attract labour and allowed Wutz to imagine that it did not sap his vital energies. A cosmopolitan man who never quite made it to the city, Wutz liked this quality in the soil up here. It was a more southern soil, packed, impervious, and carrying him over it indifferently, as a frozen lake to a skater. In the valley, the soil made demands, appelations [sirens again], like a bowl of salt in the corner of a room, it absorbed the water from the air and left his mouth dry. Its thirst was never abated. Up here the soil sealed its thirst in its own silence. Conveniently, it kept the farmers away, discouraging them from colonising it. He did not mind the shepherds, because they added a pastoral air to his neighbourhood and, like him, they worked in silence. He sentimentalised the shepherds in a way that no man of the country ever would, his idealisation was the one he imagined city folk would possess. Sometimes he struck up a conversation with one of them. In fact, they were the only people he really discussed his library, he announced the coming [cf Xmas] of every new book and they congratulated him calmly. He never quite knew whether they really understood what he was talking about, or what they imagined this library to be. On a couple of occasions he had invited them to come in and look at it but they had always declined, under some pretext or other. [* Distant themes like the mermaids, and Parisian salons - incongruous in Auenthal - are good. Shows the recalling mind of Wutz the writer. *&quot;They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have; and before the approach of a storm, and when they expected a ship would be lost, they swam before the vessel, and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea, and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors could not understand the song, they took it for the howling of the storm. And these things were never to be beautiful for them; for if the ship sank, the men were drowned, and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King.&quot; * Don&apos;t make Wutz sound too pretentious - perhaps you can hint at this idealisation but not explain it too explicitly.</div>

      <div>I stared at Wutz for years. I knew that the route to completion consisted almost exclusively of dead-ends, that once I took the story in one particular direction, it would be very difficult to steer it back. This is a tremendous inhibition; although in truth it is illusory - I can always find my way back. It is only an amplified form of that inhibition that arises out of the blank page; the inhibiting illusion that once words begin to appear on the page, it is too late to go back.</div>

      <div>Met up with LD, our annual Christmas appointment. It was friendly as usual but but she did start to get on my nerves at one point. I pooh-poohed her repetition of that old chestnut Marlboro/Orobl-Jew conspiracy theory and she said I was being condescending, truth is that something I&apos;d always known about her finally got on my nerves. She&apos;s completely wrapped up in her quiet self-righteousness, text-book definition Weak Liberal: she only wants everyone to be accepted so that she can herself be accepted. She shows no love for humanity except for those that can make her feel good about herself (old invalids). She is easily the biggest snob I&apos;ve ever met, primarily preoccupied by the class connotations of everything. She parades the cluster of self-flattering ignorances as though it were a polticial conviction.</div>

      <div>&quot;It is an International Style not only because writers from many countries work in it, but also because it travels well from one culture to another, an idiom that readers from different lands will recognize. You know the names: The Tin Drum, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Midnight&apos;s Children. Such work generally has a political edge and makes an attempt to grapple with atrocity and terror and tyranny. But it is also often grimly comic, and not above trading on the charms of the exotic. The prose is flamboyant and the narrative prolix, and those works that avoid the fantastic nevertheless rely on a steady reference to the world of folk tale and myth, to the earth-engirdling stream of an oral tradition; in Snow, the story of Sohrab and Rustum. The characterization tends to be broad and at times overdetermined in a way that verges on caricature. And far too often the fiction that employs that style has come to stand, for readers limited to English, as the embodiment of an entire national literature, as though one story could indeed do the job of many. A cynic might define it as the choice of those who expect to be read in translation; though judging by the workmanlike quality of Maureen Freely&apos;s prose I would say that Pamuk has yet to find his Gregory Rabassa.&quot; http://www.the-tls.co.uk/archive/story.aspx?story_id=2107533.</div>

      <div>&quot;Snow&apos;s occasionally intrusive narrator speaks in the first person, and his relation to the novel&apos;s action is at first unclear. Still, through its first 250 pages the novel does look like a realist narrative: a talky book, in the way of nineteenth-century Russian fiction, but not an especially tricky one. Then Pamuk jumps forwards in time in a way that defines both the narrator&apos;s identity and his characters&apos; eventual fates. Snow, it seems, is not the book one had thought, and while Pamuk quickly returns to the main line of his narative, those few pages have been enough. They give this book the kind of historically grounded and yet reflexive narrative that characterizes not only his own earlier work, but also what one might call the International Style of contemporary fiction.&quot; http://www.the-tls.co.uk/archive/story.aspx?story_id=2107533.</div>

      <div>If the lipogrammatising is uneven, the Germanic distortions would run through the English text like gobs of fat in a salami. This can happen if I lock down certain phrases I am particularly happy with [such as &quot;These were the hours of his condescension&quot;] and then work on the rest. Inevitably, some of this will happen but it is an imperfection - the words themselves need to be not only necessitated by the restriction - but to emanate from it. *This* is poetry.</div>

      <div>&quot;To see what philosophy may look like in the future, consider the problem that gave rise to the huge literature on vagueness: the paradox of the heap. Soames formulates it as follows: &apos;If one has something that is not a heap of sand, and one adds a single grain of sand to it, the result is still not a heap of sand . . . If n grains of sand are not sufficient to make a heap then n+1 grains aren&apos;t either.&apos; So it seems that &apos;no matter how many grains of sand may be gathered together, they are not sufficient to make a heap of sand.&apos;
Some philosophers, such as Crispin Wright, respond to this paradox in the spirit of Wittgenstein. They argue that (as Soames puts it) &apos;the rules governing ordinary vague predicates simply do not allow for sharp and precise lines dividing objects to which the predicates apply from objects of any other sort.&apos; Others, such as Timothy Williamson, hold (again in Soames&apos;s words) that &apos;vague predicates are in fact perfectly precise - in the sense that there are sharp and precise lines dividing objects to which they truly apply from objects to which they truly do not - but it is impossible for us ever to know where these lines are.&apos;&quot;

      <div>&quot;Somewhere or other - I think it is in the preface to Saint Joan - Bernard Shaw remarks that we are more gullible and superstitious today than we were in the Middle Ages, and as an example of modern credulity he cites the widespread belief that the earth is round. The average man, says Shaw, can advance not a single reason for thinking that the earth is round. He merely swallows this theory because there is something about it that appeals to the twentieth-century mentality.
Now, Shaw is exaggerating, but there is something in what he says, and the question is worth following up, for the sake of the light it throws on modern knowledge. Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me.
As for the Flat Earth theory, I believe I could refute it. If you stand by the seashore on a clear day, you can see the masts and funnels of invisible ships passing along the horizons. This phenomenon can only be explained by assuming that the earth&apos;s surface is curved. But it does not follow that the earth is spherical. Imagine another theory called the Oval Earth theory, which claims that the earth is shaped like an egg. What can I say against it?
Against the Oval Earth man, the first card I can play is the analogy of the sun and moon. The Oval Earth man promptly answers that I don&apos;t know, by my own observation, that those bodies are spherical. I only know that they are round, and they may perfectly well be flat discs. I have no answer to that one. Besides, he goes on, what reason have I for thinking that the earth must be the same shape as the sun and moon? I can&apos;t answer that one either.
My second card is the earth&apos;s shadow: when cast on the moon during eclipses, it appears to be the shadow of a round object. But how do I know, demands the Oval Earth man, that eclipses of the moon are caused by the shadow of the earth? The answer is that I don&apos;t know, but have taken this piece of information blindly from newspaper articles and science booklets.
Defeated in the minor exchanges, I now play my queen of trumps: the opinion of the experts. The Astronomer Royal, who ought to know, tells me that the earth is round. The Oval Earth man covers the queen with his king. Have I tested the Astronomer Royal&apos;s statement, and would I even know a way of testing it? Here I bring out my ace. Yes, I do know one test. The astronomers can foretell eclipses, and this suggests that their opinions about the solar system are pretty sound. I am therefore justified in accepting their say-so about the shape of the earth.
If the Oval Earth man answers - what I believe is true - that the ancient Egyptians, who thought the sun goes round the earth, could also predict eclipses, then bang goes my ace. I have only one card left: navigation. People can sail ships round the world, and reach the places they aim at, by calculations which assume that the earth is spherical. I believe that finishes the Oval Earth man, though even then he may possibly have some kind of counter.
It will be seen that my reasons for thinking that the earth is round are rather precarious ones. Yet this is an exceptionally elementary piece of information. On most other questions I should have to fall back on the expert much earlier, and would be less able to test his pronouncements. And much the greater part of our knowledge is at this level. It does not rest on reasoning or on experiment, but on authority. And how can it be otherwise, when the range of knowledge is so vast that the expert himself is an ignoramous as soon as he strays away from his own speciality? Most people, if asked to prove that the earth is round, would not even bother to produce the rather weak arguments I have outlined above. They would start off by saying that &apos;everyone knows&apos; the earth to be round, and if pressed further, would become angry. In a way Shaw is right. This is a credulous age, and the burden of knowledge which we now have to carry is partly responsible. &quot;.</div>

This is a faith based on a man born to a virgin. A man who rose from the dead. You may as well set out to prove that Peter Pan never flew [Peter Pan&apos;s feet never left the ground].</div>

      <div>The &apos;y&apos; is non-existent in German, the English text is practically a lipogram on &apos;y&apos; How can you write an apostrophe without using this letter? In all I had 22 ys to work with (probably from neologisms) - an expensive letter. I used many of them in the opening paragraph. This stops me from using the second person - as though having the third person of the German polite form thrust upon me. I contemplated using this for the first paragraph - but an apostrophe in the third person would be, at best, hilarious. (More to the point, adverbs are almost impossible. Which is good.) This is a clear example of the restriction affecting the content.</div>

      <div>Since Faust has lived for such a long time, time seems to go by very quickly for him, about ten times faster than it would to a 70-year-old. The day has a stroboscopic effect on him. Describe this effect (without mentioning stroboscope) - how people are caught in mid-air by daylight, how he sees their lives juddering by in front of him, how the effect has a mesmerising effect on him. Perhaps only use this when he is talking about the present, and contrast with how it used to be slower days.</div>

      <div>&quot;The reason I had made the slightly odd remark about not representing the third world is that it is sometimes argued that magic realism itself is an anti-imperialist aesthetic. In Malise Ruthven&apos;s A Satanic Affair, there is a description of a conference held in Bradford in 1989, at the height of the Rushdie dispute. Ian Wright, a lecturer in English, tried to explain to the audience the aesthetic from which The Satanic Verses is supposed to derive:
He explained how the form of &quot;magic realism&quot; developed by Jorge Luís Borges and Gabriel García Márquez in South America had deliberately subverted the dominant mode of narrative realism-the forms of Jane Austen and George Eliot, Balzac and Flaubert, Turgenev and Tolstoy-by introducing surrealistic events, like people being covered with magic butterflies or characters suddenly enabled to fly. This subversion of narrative form, he argued, had a political dimension: it involved a deliberate, self-conscious attempt to break with the &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; of European form.
But the Asians in the audience didn&apos;t want to hear this. They staged a noisy walkout. They were not mollified, in other words, to hear that the narrative realism of Turgenev had been subverted on behalf of the third world, with the implication that they are the beneficiaries.&quot;

      <div>Although I find the Oulipo project fascinating sometimes I find it - dare I say - superficial. It can come across as Chess-club puzzling. They talk about marrying language with mathematics but really it&apos;s more simple arithmetic at best. Contemporary mathematics is near-mystical in its abstraction and is probably closer to fiction. The part of Oulipo I am really interested in is its occasional hint that the work can happen at the linguistic level.</div>

      <div>Assertive atheism is at least as ridiculous as religion. Faced with the sheer absurdity of existence, it is pompous of an atheist to look down on religion. The explanation that the universe came out of nothing is at least as ridiculous as to say that it was created by God. Faced with the story of humanity, [teleology] to say that our history, our wars our sufferng, our triumphs (and the everyday ones) are ordained by no governing principle is at least as ridiculous as saying that the Holy Trinity or the God of Muhammad has caused it. Or, for that matter, a pink fluffy bunny. Problem is: positing God is only giving the mystery a name (Occam&apos;s razor). Atheism&apos;s claims are modest - it is simply an intellectual courtesy. RIPE.</div>

      <div>The fallacy of phonetic spelling. It&apos;s ridiculous ... Admittedly it gives colour - but this kind of colour is considered distasteful when it&apos;s done vocally. It&apos;s an artificial colour. Even Joyce [check] is not above this. When the writer is ascribing this to a foreigner it is patronising, when it&apos;s the writer&apos;s own language there is a certain regional claim. What does the written word represent? This is not to attack the variety of pronounciation - which is legitimate. Word and thing - the written word is a stylised record of the utterance, not its parody. The point of regional difference is that we pronounce the same word differently, if we pronounce different words differently - it is not variation but segregation. National pressures.</div>

      <div>One of the joys of reading a book in translation is that you can imagine that you are reading, as best you can, a &apos;perfect&apos; book. You are reading it &apos;imperfectly&apos; of course, but you can allow yourself to imagine that in the original Turkish, Russian, Polish the book is the perfect synthesis of form and function, that the author makes perfect use of the unique nature of his native language, that idiom is deployed with accuracy and restraint. Any failures between form and function are down to the necessarily imperfect nature of the act of translation and, perhaps, the translator&apos;s incompetence. This is the translator as fall guy, scapegoat for the imperfections of language. While reading it we can extrapolate from the translator&apos;s words to a perfect work. (We can do this when reading in the original but the present work, in its pretence of finality, punctures the illusion.) We can fill the gap between the words and the perfect work more comfortably. [TRACE: difference between a real and a virtual image; how does our mind form a virtual image? This is RIPE. The imperfections of translation obliterate the imperfections of writng, the imperfections of language. Freed from the oppressive definitive nature of the original... We know the current translation is makeshift...</div>

      <div>&quot;The diacritic marks umlaut and dieresis [chiefly Am.] (also spelled diaeresis [chiefly Br.]) are identical in appearance but different in function. The dieresis (Greek &quot;to take apart&quot;) indicates that the vowel so marked is to be pronounced separately from the one preceeding it (e.g., naïve, Noël) or that the vowel should be sounded when it might otherwise be silent (e.g., Brontë) [...] The origin of the German umlaut is an abbreviated &quot;e&quot; i.e. The vowel is influenced by the following (semi-)vowel &quot;e&quot; in a process called apophany, therefore the correct transliteration of an umlaut is to use an &quot;e&quot; after the vowel. Umlauts occur mostly in Germanic languages but also for example in Finnish. When German words with umlauts are assimilated into the English language, they sometimes keep their umlauts (e.g., doppelgänger, Flügelhorn, föhn, Der Freischütz, führer, jäger, kümmel, Künstlerroman, schweizerkäse, über-), but often are simply written without the diacritic (e.g., doppelganger, flugelhorn, Der Freischutz, yager), and less often are correctly transliterated using an &quot;e&quot; (e.g., foehn, fuehrer, jaeger, loess). Of course, sometimes more than one spelling makes its way into English. Muesli could have originated from Müesli or Müsli, so it&apos;s not clear if the umlaut was lost or transliterated.&quot; http://germanenglishwords.com/rlgu.htm.</div>

      <div>&quot;And even when we realise that the task is beyond our skill, that our powers cannot cope with it, we feel that we should be less discontented if we gave to our powers, already overtaxed, something still further to do.
And such is, indeed, the fact. The wish to ccomplish something outside their formal programme is common to all men who in the course of evolution have risen past a certain level.
Until an effort is made to satisfy that wish, the sense of uneasy waiting for something to start which has not started will remain to disturb the peace of the soul. That wish has been called by many
names. It is one form of the universal desire for knowledge. And it is so strong that men whose whole lives have been given to the
systematic acquirement of knowledge have been driven by it to overstep the limits of their programme in search of still more knowledge. Even Herbert Spencer, in my opinion the greatest mind
that ever lived, was often forced by it into agreeable little backwaters of inquiry.&quot;

      <div>&quot;As I have previously said, the chief beauty about the constant supply of time is that you cannot waste it in advance. The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you, as perfect, as unspoilt, as if you had never wasted or misapplied a single moment in all your career. Which fact is very gratifying and reassuring. You can turn over a new leaf every hour if you choose. Therefore no object is served in waiting till next week, or even until to-morrow. You may fancy that the water will be warmer next week. It won&apos;t. It will be colder.&quot; - Arnold Bennett, How to live on 24 Hours A Day.</div>

      <div>The contemporary consensus about immoral works of art being unacceptable never extends to fashionable things like rap. &quot;Eminem&apos;s entrée into the mainstream occurs right at the moment when rap music, his chosen form, is being censured on these shores for promoting what Culture Minister Kim Howells last week called &apos;a culture where killing is almost a fashion accessory&apos; Rappers, according to Howells, were &apos;boasting macho idiots&apos; which, by extension, makes the world&apos;s biggest rapper the most boastful macho idiot. Eminem would no doubt agree with all but the last part of that triple billing.&quot; http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,872956,00.html
Would the Guardian also call White Supremacist Rock an authentic expression etc. Is the argument that it is immoral but redeemed by being art (which I would accept).
Sometimes, I suspect, we want to be prigs without running the risk of being moralist.</div>

      <div>&quot;I begin to think that great writers of fiction are by the mysterious nature of their art ordained to be &quot;amateurs.&quot; There may be something of the amateur in all great artists. I do not know why it should be so, unless because, in the exuberance of their sense of power, they are impatient of the exactitudes of systematic study and the mere bother of repeated attempts to arrive at a minor perfection. Assuredly no great artist was ever a profound scholar. The great artist has other ends to achieve.&quot; - Bennett, The Writer&apos;s Craft.</div>

      <div>Proper television is Big Brother - but the content is terrible. But if the Modernists made TV - this would be it (because the content completely eploits the form). Is it possible to make &apos;proper&apos; TV with good content? Is it a sign of the medium&apos;s intrinsic inferiority that - at its apotheosis - it produces such terrible stuff? Like Modernism, it alienates anyone who isn&apos;t completely into it. Many would said the same apropos of Ulysses - that the novel, at its apotheosis, does fascinating things with form but leaves the content in tatters. Obviously, to the Modernists, form and content were one.</div>

«Noi veggiam, come quei c&apos;ha mala luce,

      <div>&quot;After deliberating to whom he should dedicate his book - to the &apos;victims of torture&apos;, Levinson says, seemed like a &apos;sentimental gesture, especially inasmuch as several of the essays, including my own, countenance the possibility that under some very restricted circumstances, it might be the &quot;lesser evil&quot; to engage in torture&apos; - Levinson decides to send &apos;this book . . . Into the world without a dedicatee&apos;. But all those victims who had hoped to find themselves on the dedication page of Levinson&apos;s book need not despair. For he is &apos;pleased to say that every contributor concurred in a suggestion that all of the royalties attached to this book will go not to the authors but rather to the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition&apos;.&quot; On Charity as a Moral Earth, etc. http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n10/print/robi02_.html.</div>

      <div>Faith is a Christian concept - and especially a Protestant one. As a child I was always annoyed by the blackmail of faith; this great leap of the imagination that was expected of me. [TRACE reference in La Era Urbana - NY 2] Even in Catholicism, you still feel the pagan attitude to faith - that you are collectively going through the motions of faith, the ritual of believing. Even though, of course, all the explicit teaching, the cathjechism, is all counter-reformation and closer to the Protestant idea of a personal relationship with God. Faith, too, is not really important in Judaeism.</div>

The novel is long because it is a process, like chewing the apple of the Tree of Knowledge: it takes the novel a while before it discovers its human nakedness. The short forms are short because they begin with completion-with knowledge of nakedness.&quot; http://www.nybooks.com/articles/8891.</div>

      <div>Ultimately we (artists) are parasites. We only come about through a society&apos;s surplus, an economy&apos;s surplus, a social class&apos;s surplus, a family&apos;s surplus. It normally takes a family a couple of generations of bourgeoisie reliably to start producing artists. Sure, there are short-circuits. (Just as it took a surplus of grown sons and daughters in Catholic families to produce vocations - the fall in birth rate in Catholic countries is surely part of the cause of the decline in vocations. The only child&apos;s sperm and ova are far too precious.) This is not to diminish art, surplus is the only purpose of life I can see, the rest is survival and eternal deferral of human purpose - passing on the hot potato.</div>

      <div>Waiting for the bus to Amalfi, a man talks on his mobile loudly. He is overweight with a small head and a neat beard that seems to have circles cut out for his apertures and a useless one for his bald patch [salt-tax windows]. He talks about Brian (&quot;inculare Bri-an&quot;) and about setting up a trust so that they can bypass something. The bank of Luxembourg wrote a cheque ad personam rather than &quot;ad government&quot; He mentions figures of 100 - 300,000. At one point he gets angry and shouts something about passports and Switzerland. Some passports were meant to be couriered but they didn&apos;t make it. His girlfriend calls out his name, telling him not to shout. She is reading Il Sole 24 Ore, she is blonde and has a few extra inches - not much. His Italian is sprinkled with Business English, &quot;bypassare&quot; &quot;board of dierectors&quot; When he hangs up, he reads out a text to her which seems to be coming from his family. He says he won&apos;t answer but his girlfriend tells him he should. He says he will tell them that they&apos;ve run away to the Maldives. Then he asks her if she wants to go with him to the Maldives, &quot;una zingarata&quot; She is noncommittal. He says he will pay 70% - as usual - but on his credit card. Later she tries to see whether the shop gave her the right change. She tries to add up but can&apos;t find the prices of the various magazines she has. He tells her they&apos;re always on the cover. She can&apos;t make out whether they&apos;re separate magazines or sections of each other. He says he is always right and she should acknowledge this. She says no. He says she should always defer to the one who pays the bills and she agrees with a smile. They seem familiar and comfortable with each other but not affectionate. When they speak it is as though they are doing it for the benefit of a third party, performing. Even when he was momentarily angry on the phone, there was never a hint of malice in his voice.</div>

      <div>ST invited me to dinner, to meet her mum. I want to &quot;make an effort&quot; without making too much of an effort - so as not to appear as though I were meeting my future mother-in-law. Once, me, ST, ST2 and Ali, went to drop something off at ST&apos;s house. Her mum was inside. Ali and I stayed outside. ST2 asked me, &quot;Why are _you_ nervous?&quot; Another time she told me, &quot;You&apos;re in our mother&apos;s bad books.&quot;.</div>

      <div>In July, DT asked me whether I knew she were leaving the country in September. Didn&apos;t know whether she was being careful for me or for herself. We were in St James&apos; park, it had been a cloudy day, but after a dull day the grey cloud was absorbing London&apos;s night lights, sponging it up, and through the gaps you could see a cobalt twilight. There was a line of ducks in the middle of the pond and a generator.</div>

      <div>The obsession with conspiracy infects &quot;left-wing&quot; (if it can be called that - anti-globalist, etc). This, oddly, is a feature it shares with the far-right. Let us not forget The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were pressed into service by the Nazis and that the same conspiracy - if in a slightly less explicit form - governed it. It is corrupt, naive, oddly theistic coming from (usually) avowed agnostics. A James Bond vision of the nature of evil. When you get to this level, the truth breaks down, politics breaks down and you&apos;re working at the level of the individual. Crime and political thriller are separate genres. RIPE.</div>

      <div>Obviously, it&apos;s easy to think of a word as untranslatable when your competence in another language - or your competence as a translator - leaves something to be desired. This is a profound point about our sense of identity. [??] The illusion of translatability is only caused by our lack of knowledge. Perhaps this is why bilinguals are considered inferior translators to monolinguals who have (artificially) acquired the source language [Steiner].</div>

The Blues, for that matter, is the same as all these terms - and equally undefinable, an untranslatable &apos;Black&apos; thing - and guarded just as jealously (&quot;What is the Blues? If you have to ask, you&apos;ll never get it.&quot; - special pleading). Use &quot;Black and Blue&quot; as connector to Sawda, Saudad, etc.</div>

      <div>Maltese is a spoken language - for various reasons. It is young as a written language; commercial limitations - a small market size - means that there can never be things like instructions on the back of products in Maltese, etc. Perhaps the way forward is in the spoken forms of literature - plays, etc. Not for nothing are the fathers of a language normally writing in these forms. (And, in any case, the first forms of literature were spoken.).</div>

      <div>The very first sentence I ever wrote - with writerly ambitions - was, &quot;I wish I were somewhere where I wouldn&apos;t wish I were anywhere else.&quot; It bears all the marks of adolescence. In truth, that sentence started with &quot;Sometimes&quot; - which was there to add a &quot;bloom of remoteness&quot;, as Nabokov had it. It then turned out that this is very much Goethe&apos;s Faust&apos;s desire. (&quot;Stay, so fair thou art...&quot;) I&apos;ve only ever felt this when I&apos;m having a good conversation at dinner and, occasionally, during sex.</div>

      <div>&quot;Although potentially disingenuous, this procedure offers the novelist one way to explore that hazy territory between the simple indicative, which outstrips his knowledge, and the frankly fictional, which seems insufficiently urgent. In a 1914 piece on the essay form, Musil defined the genre as &quot;the strictest form attainable in an area where one cannot work precisely.&quot; The essay, he wrote, &quot;takes its form and method from science, its matter from art.&quot; In the first volume of The Man Without Qualities, the narrator observes that &quot;a man who wants the truth becomes a scholar; a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become a writer; but what should a man do who wants something in between?&quot; The short answer, no doubt, is that he writes The Man Without Qualities.&quot; Http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/14/feb96/musil.htm.</div>

      <div>&quot;An energetic (not to say fanatical) rewriter- a literary perfectionist, really-Musil had retrieved the galleys from the printer and was in the process of extensively reworking them when, in April 1942 at the age of sixty-two, he suddenly collapsed from a cerebral hemorrhage and died. Apparently, he succumbed while performing his morning gymnastics (another activity to which he was fanatically devoted). According to his widow, who found him a short while later, the look on his face was one of &quot;mockery and mild astonishment.&quot; Http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/14/feb96/musil.htm.</div>

      <div>&quot;Men who once merely headed minor sects have become aged celebrities; publishers and art dealers have become rich; new movements are constantly being started; everybody attends both the academic and the avant-garde shows, and even the avant-garde of the avant-garde; the family magazines have bobbed their hair; politicians like to sound off on the cultural arts, and newspapers make literary history. ... Persons who would before never have been taken seriously became famous. Harshness mellowed, separations fused, intransigents made concessions to popularity, tastes already formed relapsed in uncertainties. Sharp boundaries everywhere became blurred and some new, indefinable ability to form alliances brought new people and new ideas to the top.&quot; TRACE page.</div>

      <div>GG said that a year before his First Holy Communion he had seen our grandmother pissing in the slop, she&apos;d raised her skirt and he caught a glimpse of her arse. As his first confession was approaching he tried to figure out whether it was a sin. He had just about worked out the concept of Free Will, and consoled himself with the knowledge that the glimpse was involuntary. When he was in line for confession, he turned white, so much that Rev Cachia asked his &quot;G, are you all right?&quot; He didn&apos;t confess it. His great worry, of course, was that he would receive communion in a state of sin and thereby commit a sacrilege.</div>

      <div>There is a point to be made re material equivalence - ontology, epistemology - going down to material equivalence of the amount of ink... And the material equivalence, the ontological fact that we are referring to the same thing. I.e. The equivalence of the ink, and later the letters, is symbolic of the fact that a translation is still an attempt that depicting the same things, an epistemological wager.

      <div>An afternoon dream: I was at home in my living room when people from Malta started turning up, including a sexy and young version of Graziella tal-Bramel (who looked nothing like her but I recongnised her to be Graziella) and another girl I thought I recognised then but I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t now. There were also many of Malcolm&apos;s friends or young slim camp men. They started smoking weed though I didn&apos;t see them do this or smell it. (Odd how in a dream, perception can be so separate from sensory data.) Then there was a knock on the door, which I didn&apos;t really hear. I went out to see who it is but I took a detour. Turns out that my front door does not lead to the street but my entire flat is below ground level and is in a sort of basin of roughly-cut mediterranean stone. (This did not surprise me and either during or afterwards, Ihad the impression that I&apos;ve dreamt of this setting before.) On the way I started chatting to people first in Italian and then they gradually started talking to me in Maltese. I seemed to be asking them for directions. A buxom girl wearing a brown dress with a print of white flowers outlined in yellow took me by the arm to lead me to the front door, started chatting and asked me whether she could come and see me sometime... This reminds me of a time when Omar and Therese were at my flat in Malta, just before I moved here, they were smoking pot, and the neighbour came to tell me that my bath was leaking. He told me he lived in England, and that his family was in England.</div>

      <div>Freud&apos;s &quot;Fort! Da!&quot; episode (about a child regaining control over his mother&apos;s appearance and disappearance by reproducing it with a small toy) is somehow relevant to Scarry&apos;s notion that images become more real if we have this notion of occlusion. We regain control over the object of our imagination.</div>

      <div>CM-M was here in the morning, after a weekend together, we were already dressed for work. I put some coffee on the stove. In the bedroom, I took her from behind while she leaned on the radiator. Half an hour later, I went back to the kitchen, the moka was dry and hot. The gaskets had melted away. I tried to repair it but didn&apos;t get it right. Instead of a virile explosion, I got a whimper which I had to associate with vigorous rear entry.</div>

      <div>My relationship with colour is strange. This is partly baggage from BS, partly to do with the sensory purity, elimination of noise, of writing. That writing uses primitives. What about black &amp; white film? It&apos;s not that I&apos;m scared of colour, it&apos;s that I treat it as though it were sacred. RIPE.</div>

      <div>A dream: I&apos;m on the top floor of a Maltese-looking house. I&apos;m on the top floor, the staircase, just a couple of steps down. RG-S and GG come out of the bedroom at the far end of the corridor. GG walks past me, down the stairs, RG-S stretches herself over the bannisters, across the stairwell. She is wearing gauzy, baby-blue bra and pants, her honey-coloured nipples (as I saw them on a polaroid of her years ago in GG&apos;s wardrobe) peek completely out of her bra. She tells me, look at his eyes, his nose, they&apos;re not his. As she mentions these features, in turn, her own come into stark relief. Her eyes are impossibly big, and aquamarine, and heavily made-up. They look old; she didn&apos;t look old from a slight distance. Later we&apos;re in a car, she hands me a bundle of money. It&apos;s very compact, just a few notes; somehow this makes it look like a lot of money. The notes themselves are purple with very fine detail, it looks like old money and I wonder where she could have got it. There is a green post-it note attached to them. She says, &quot;Kill him&quot; Somehow, the dream doesn&apos;t disturb me at all. That day I&apos;d received a new photo of the child from GG, and watched Time of the Gypsies with ST. Paternity issues are a recurring theme. And, of course, GG&apos;s own obsession with paternity and DNA tests.</div>

      <div>&quot;Attraverso il marxismo, l&apos;apostolato dei giovani estremisti di estrazione borghese - l&apos;apostolato in favore della coscienza dei diritti e della volontà di realizzarli - altro non è che la rabbia inconscia del borghese povero contro il borghese ricco, del borghese giovane contro il borghese vecchio, del borghese impotente contro il borghese potente, del borghese piccolo contro il borghese grande. E&apos; un&apos;inconscia guerra civile - mascherata da lotta di classe - dentro l&apos;inferno della coscienza borghese. (Si ricordi bene: sto parlando di estremisti, non di comunisti).&quot;

      <div>In 1997 I took on a full-time, well-paid job because I wanted to avoid the false syllogism to which I&apos;d observed many moderately successful artistic careers succumb. &quot;To retain my artistic integrity I must put art before money. Therefore to retain my artistic integrity I must accept being broke. I am broke - therefore my artistic integrity is intact.&quot; The dire financial situation becomes itself an achievement.</div>

      <div>Maugham, 1933: &quot;Death speaks: There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, &quot;Master, just now when I was in the market-place I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there death will not find me.&quot; The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went.
Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, &quot;Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning?&quot; &quot;That was not a threatening gesture,&quot; I said, &quot;it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.&quot; http://www.snopes.com/rumors/wtcfate.htm.</div>

      <div>From The Great Gatsby: On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas. A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. &quot;What do you think?&quot; he demanded impetuously. &quot;About what?&quot; He waved his hand toward the book-shelves. &quot;About that. As a matter of fact you needn&apos;t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They&apos;re real.&quot; &quot;The books?&quot; He nodded. &quot;Absolutely real-have pages and everything. I thought they&apos;d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they&apos;re absolutely real. Pages and-Here! Lemme show you.&quot; Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the &quot;Stoddard Lectures.&quot; &quot;See!&quot; he cried triumphantly. &quot;It&apos;s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella&apos;s a regular Belasco. It&apos;s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too-didn&apos;t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?&quot; He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse. &quot;Who brought you?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.&quot; Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering. &quot;I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,&quot; he continued. &quot;Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I&apos;ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.&quot; &quot;Has it?&quot; &quot;A little bit, I think. I can&apos;t tell yet. I&apos;ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They&apos;re real. They&apos;re--&quot; &quot;You told us.&quot; We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.</div>

      <div>This man is the only one at Gatsby&apos;s funeral (besides the narrator):
As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby&apos;s books in the library one night three months before.</div>

      <div>A dream: I was at my mother&apos;s house shaving the hair on my hips with an electric razor, wearing swimming trunks, on the roof, suddenly i&apos;m on the ground floor. There are two builders, one well-built, looks like a tanned Jon Rose, another older with white hair, also well-built. They ask me what that brand of &apos;filter&apos; (I have a pale beige can of &apos;filter&apos; with black lettering on it) I look at the can and it says, BLAIR in capitals. The older man says something amusing. A Land Rover turns up with more builders. These are wearing a black corduroy jacket, black jeans, and black poloneck. One of them, a handsome black man greets the builders by kissing them on the mouth. Then CM-M turns up, also in a Land Rover, comes to an abrupt halt and says, &quot;Oh God, it&apos;s you. In amused embarrassment, [part of her repertoire]. Then I&apos;m on my way somewhere and someone points out Shona (from camberwell). then I go to this place which looks very much like an old Maltese house. There is a large staircase in a courtyard and it&apos;s very crowded, it looks like the first day of term. I&apos;m walking up and a south-american girl in front of me takes one false step and she has one leg dangling over the banister.I managed to get hold of her in the last minute, with one arm across my torso. She is saved but needs to extract her foot (&amp;amp; high-wedged sandal out of the ironwork). At this same place there is also a boutique, they have very nice stripy socks, and a top that looks like my D&amp;amp;G one but like a cardigan, except their new model has feminine trimmings. I point this out to a very smartly dressed and genteel Ken Russell. He agrees. We say goodbye, after I express my admiration for him, and say Iwill see him tomorrow (implying &apos;at the thing&apos;). He says, &apos;one doesn&apos;t like to be approached&apos; then repeats this. But soon after we are talking again and he asks me,&apos;do you have leadership qualities&apos; I say I have led a team before but it&apos;s not what I enjoy doing. At the same time I seem to be up for a job assessment with a young and handsome man who seems to like me (professionally). As part of my assessment he will require of me an essay of about 2,000 words. He will give me five topics to choose from. There is also talk of the Foundation (which we seem to be contracted to). The Foundation is preserving something and it turns out that it&apos;s a historic vacuum cleaner. &quot;An &apos;oova&quot; we say, and laugh. I truthfully say that Ihad suspected this. ST, ST2, and I are then leaving the empty building. ST2 and I discuss Maltese, in Maltese, which she speaks beautifully. She uses the masculine gender when referring to Maltese. I infer from this that she is thinking of it as &apos;lsien&apos; rather than &apos;lingwa&apos; - I am very impressed by this. We are in a corridor on our way to meet ST. I remember that I have to go back for something. I catch a glimpse of Olsa, the Swedish girl, she is being courted by an older-man who looks like a professor. I happen to see them on an escalator and notice that she stands two steps behind him, I was relieved that she did not seem too interested in him. He was in his early fifties, thin, and tall, with bushy hair on the sides and silver-rimmed spectacles. back home, i&apos;m now in bed when I hear someone coming into the flat, running up the stairs and dashing into Godwin&apos;s room. I try to assess whether I should be scared and try to calculate how scared I would be if this were happening in my flat in Bethnal Green. Then they rush into the bathroom and I realise it&apos;s a group of people running in a synchronised, slightly cartoonish, fashion. Stroboscopically, I catch a glimpse of a small red handbag. I am now downstairs, there&apos;s a modern take-away at the corner. Behind the counter is a man who looks like the brother of the black &apos;builder/actor. My mother, a strong woman of affairs in her fifties says I have to show up the following day so I can take care of &apos;the fighter&apos; I infer from this that CM-M started a fight. I am surprised that my mother has been running a theatre festival in our own house without explicitly inviting me. I see the invitations, the logo seems to be a stylised rendition of cupids in a circle, like in &apos;a dance to the music of time&apos; the tasteful invite gives the address as Block 2/11...</div>

      <div>There is the common belief among self-professed agnostics that the church has corrupted christ&apos;s teachings. They don&apos;t seem to realise what a strong testament this is to the church&apos;s successful protrayal of christ. For if the only christ they, and could possibly know of, is the one given to them by the church, what gives them sufficient reason to suspect that he was even better. Is this simply the differential of distrust of institutions, added with the automatic lionisation of rebels. How come they never believe that christ was a mendacious bigot who has been improved and glossed over by the church? (Icouldn&apos;t get myself to add, &quot;as may well be the case&quot;) this makes sense in a protestant sense, and perhaps points out the difference between a catholic atheist and a protestant atheist. Agnosticism, among protestants, is rarely free of a very protestant distrust of catholcism. And probably vice-versa.</div>

When peter mandhelson was appointed as minister for northern ireland, some play was made of blair&apos;s shrewdness at choosing a jewish man, thus suggesting he would be neutral and acceptable to both sides. Soon, however, the question was being asked, is he a catholic or a protestant jew?</div>

      <div>Why is the slightly scary thing about there being creative writing courses, generating a batch of pretenders every year? The same happens with directors, actors, musicians, visual artists. Maybe with writing we like to imagine that there is a finite number of stories out there. Also, their output will make far greater demands on us than any performance or visual work ever will.</div>

      <div>IPA picked up Pnin and immediately complained about a line that said that the train moved inexorably, she said inexorably &quot;was an unnecessary word&quot; Another time, she picked up Torless and immediately said, &quot;Why is it always women that are said to be highly-strung?&quot; The only other book of mine she&apos;s ever picked up is Pessoa. That one seemed shut her up. It&apos;s a strange form of reacting to intimidation. When I told her I was re-reading The Great Gatsby, she said Gatsby really infuriates her, but taking it against the book. A strange envy.</div>

      <div>LT (from email 12.09.05): &quot;Afterwards, when I came back, I kept inside me the rhythm of the journey. I did everything very slowly (you know how fast I smoked, talked, drinked, walked...) and inside it felt good. But I guess that just wasn&apos;t enough, unfortunately. All the changes in the last few years (country, cities, jobs, more than a few houses, several weird house mates and many many questions) have taken their toll (is this how you say it?)&quot;.</div>

      <div>Went to FJ&apos;s for New Year&apos;s Eve dinner. We knew there was a party going on next door, they had slipped a note under the door, pre-apologising for any noise, but they turned out to be young English people having a fancy-dress party. They played Take That. One of the girls was dressed as a cavewoman - she had a marvellous body, her eyes were sunk deep into her face. Her boyfriend had floppy hair and looked twelve. She kept emphasising they were all graduated from Cambridge. In her costume she looked like a hothoused upper middle-class girl in a domestic production of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. She was not that posh, though.</div>

      <div>Spoke with cavewoman about diversity in Cities (London/Paris). RL had also referred to this. I think the reason why in London we have such great mixture geographically is because it doesn&apos;t mean a genuine social mix. The UK, in fact, has a far lower social mobility than Europe. It is the &quot;Englishman&apos;s home is his castle&quot; that allow anyone to set up a small fortification wherever he may please.</div>

      <div>FJ drunkenly tried it on, first with Natasha then with Lena. He had previously jokingly said that the reason Lasik failed with him was because he had done it out of vanity - and God punished him. While he started &apos;caressing&apos; Natasha she developed a great conversational interest in me. Later I got talking to Lena about drunkenness - completely in different context, re 24hr licences - and then worried I must have sounded self-righteous.</div>

      <div>&quot;Full of such humor, and perhaps the miserablest man in the whole French Capital or Suburbs, was I, one sultry Dog- day, after much perambulation, toiling along the dirty little Rue Saint-Thomas de l&apos;Enfer among civic rubbish enough, in a close atmosphere, and over pavements hot as Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s Furnace; whereby doubtless my spirits were little cheered; when, all at once, there rose a Thought in me, and I asked myself: &apos;What art thou afraid of? Wherefore, like a coward, dost thou forever pip and whimper, and go cowering and trembling? Despicable biped! What is the sum-total of the worst that lies before thee? Death? Well, Death; and say the pangs of Tophet too, and all that the Devil and Man may, will or can do against thee! Hast thou not a heart; canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be; and, as a Child of Freedom, though outcast, trample Tophet itself under thy feet, while it consumes thee? Let it come, then; I will meet it and defy it!&apos; And as I so thought, there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul; and I shook base Fear away from me forever. I was strong, of unknown strength; a spirit, almost a god. Ever from that time, the temper of my misery was changed: not Fear or whining Sorrow was it, but Indignation and grim fire-eyed Defiance. &quot;Thus had the EVERLASTING NO (das ewige Nein) pealed authoritatively through all the recesses of my Being, of my ME; and then was it that my whole ME stood up, in native God-created majesty, and with emphasis recorded its Protest. Such a Protest, the most important transaction in Life, may that same Indignation and Defiance, in a psychological point of view, be fitly called. The Everlasting No had said: &apos;Behold, thou art fatherless, outcast, and the Universe is mine (the Devil&apos;s);&apos; to which my whole Me now made answer: &apos;I am not thine, but Free, and forever hate thee!&apos;. &quot;It is from this hour that I incline to date my Spiritual New-birth, or Baphometic Fire-baptism; perhaps I directly thereupon began to be a Man.&quot;.</div>

I also remember once I was in form 3, I&apos;d bought A Night at the Opera / A Day at the races the day before - the first music I&apos;d ever bought and I was inexplicably happy that day. Even though I got a Wednesday. I remember walking in line with John Zarb. But this was either the last time I felt true joy or - more probably - the first time.</div>

      <div>&quot;A popular 19th-century theory held that men and animals inherit traits not just from their parents but also from their mother&apos;s first partner. This supposed phenomenon was called &quot;the taint of the quagga&quot; because it was said to have been discovered in the animal. The taint was alluded to by journalists of the era and in the writings of Goethe, Strindberg, Ibsen, and Zola. It reinforced the taboo of miscegenation and encouraged men to keep their women under lock and key.&quot; http://www.slate.com/id/2132747/.</div>

      <div>The self-righteous man on the tube, usually drunk, forcing bitter cheer on people. A man came on today, well-built and rather well-spoken. He smelt. He picked on a tall, bronze blonde woman, not terribly attractive, and then kept asking her where her broom is. &quot;Baker Street&quot; he shouted, &quot;lost property. You lost your broom&quot; He seemed to be in a good mood, smelt slightly of alcohol. He was wearing military-style slacks and carried an orange Sainsbury&apos;s &apos;bag for life&apos; He started calling everyone 7am risers, then made a rather authentic alarm sound. &quot;Slaves,&quot; he said. He got off at Baker Street.</div>

It&apos;s a bit like a hairdresser getting testosterone-fuelled delusions about himself just because his signature cut is a short-back and sides. (And chefs! They wear an apron for a living.).</div>

Only I have a better memory than the others. I have not forgotten the former inability to swim. But since I have not forgotten it, being able to swim is of no help to me; and so, after all, I cannot swim.&apos;&quot; http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n04/newt01_.html [whole article &amp; reviewed book is interesting] (LRB Vol. 28 No. 4 dated 23 February 2006).</div>

      <div>&quot;The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects &apos;unfamiliar&apos;, to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object; the object is not important.&quot; (Viktor Shklovsky, &quot;Art as Technique&quot; 12) [Wikipedia.</div>

      <div>&quot;And this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook which takes it as a matter of course that youth and adventure-almost, indeed, individual life-end with marriage. One of the few authentic class-differences, as opposed to class-distinctions, still existing in England is that the working classes age very much earlier. They do not live less long, provided that they survive their childhood, nor do they lose their physical activity earlier, but they do lose very early their youthful appearance.&quot; Orwell http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/donaldmcgill.htm.</div>

      <div>&quot;It is a commonplace that the history of civilisation is largely the history of weapons. In particular, the connection between the discovery of gunpowder and the overthrow of feudalism by the bourgeoisie has been pointed out over and over again. And though I have no doubt exceptions can be brought forward, I think the following rule would be found generally true: that ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will tend to be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance. Thus, for example, tanks, battleships and bombing planes are inherently tyrannical weapons, while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon-so long as there is no answer to it-gives claws to the weak.&quot; Orwell, cf Terrorism www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/youatombomb.htm.</div>

      <div>A heroic act of reading my father had performed some time before I was born. He had borrowed [sits there, maroon binding, pages dimpled by the impact of the keys, the hours, the bell ringing several thousand times, the clatter, when Ilook at it, it is not silent, it clatters] Considering the several weeks it took him to type out the book, and considering the fact that he had an established part-time occupation as a clockmaker, it should not have been difficult for him to calculate the opportunity cost of such an endeavour. However expensive the book might have been, the cost of paper, ink and binding, added to the hours he spent typing which he could have spent repairing clocks and watches would certainly have paid for the book several times over. (Efficiency has never been a great family trait.) RIPE as standalone. A perverse reaction to the injunctions of self-help book. Adorno would have swooned (re the production of a useless text). Quote from the book.</div>

      <div>&quot;Some time in 1998 I had lunch with Bioy in his favourite restaurant, near the Recoleta cemetery. He raised the subject of his English bookseller. It was either Hatchard&apos;s or Blackwell&apos;s, but whichever it was he thought he should move to the other. He needed to know what I thought. I did not know. I told him about the internet but he said he was too old. I asked him if he could always find the book he was looking for among his own books at home, and he said it was hard, that his parents had left him a vast library in French and Spanish, and he himself read in English and Italian as well. In a tired and melancholy tone, he said: &apos;Some people say I have the largest personal library in South America.&apos;&quot; http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n09/toib01_.html.</div>

      <div>Since that day when I was introduced to him, I have carried these letters with me, trying to understand Wutz through them. My companion for five years, he has travelled with me everywhere, a persistent mist in all my thoughts, my friendships and conversation. Time and again I have marked days in my calendar by which time I were to have understood him. I wished for a pentecostal instant, which would suddenly reveal the meaning of these letters to me but the closest I ever came to ecstacy was nausea. A halo of meaning surrounds these letters, I can just about perceive it, a disconcerting light in the corner of my eyes. I can read the letters - let no one tell me nothing is being communicated here! But they conspire to form alienating words.</div>

      <div>I was introduced to the schoolmaster Maria Wutz one day five years ago while reading Walter Benjamin&apos;s Unpacking My Library. &quot;Of all the ways of acquiring books,&quot; Benjamin says, &quot;writing them oneself is regarded as the most praiseworthy method. At this point many of you will remember with pleasure the large library which Jean Paul&apos;s poor little schoolmaster Wutz gradually acquired by writing, himself, all the works whose titles interested him in bookfair catalogues; after all, he could not afford to buy them.&quot;.</div>

      <div>At the table next to me, a couple is selling some sort of pyramid scheme. The man is long-haired, Maltese, is charming and fluent. The woman is Russian (Olga), friendly and quiet. The foil is also Maltese (though the whole thing is transacted in English). The macguffin is a range of beauty products but really it&apos;s a pyramid scheme; this is explicitly but swiftly alluded to. Lots of words like ambition, success, realising your potential, etc are used.</div>

      <div>My instinctive reaction was to go out and buy the book. Had I succeeded, the whole story would probably have ended right there; and the last five years of my life may have been very different. On my way home, I would have sniffed around the story, read the biographical note, considered reading the introduction if one were provided, read the first couple of paragraphs. Then I would have carried the book around with me and re-read the first couple of paragraphs several times.</div>

      <div>If I felt myself being drawn inexorably into the narrative - an unlikely event that happens, at most, once or twice a year - I would have paused and considered whether I should stop reading whatever else it was I had been reading before buying this book. If the Schoolmaster Wutz were a short book, I might have considered it as a brief interlude. If not, I might have read on up to about a third of it and thus open another set of parentheses - along with all the other books I&apos;ve started reading - which may never be closed. I&apos;m a compulsive and attentive reader; but a slow one. Finishing the last two-thirds of the book would have required something to rekindle my interest in the book, another reference perhaps, or the sudden fantasy of sitting down with a good story.</div>

      <div>But that is not the way things happened. The book was not on the Fiction shelves. Between Patterson and Paver, there was only that void that marks one of the emptiest feelings of my emotional life, the disappointing sequence of letters that starts promisingly but is then suddenly short-circuited into the next author&apos;s name. I always find myself reiterating the alphabet to myself, phrased into a faint sing-song. In the Classics, by which most bookshops mean old or stubborn bestsellers, Parkman abruptly gave way to Pirandello. I had already considered that Paul was an unlikely surname, especially for a German author. It was more plausibly a pseudonym, like Saki or Colette, carefully intended to avoid the additional freighted affectation of a family name. Still, nothing came of it: Jarrar, then Jelinek; James, then Jerome. So that evening, on my own bookshelves, Pamuk remained the intimate neighbour of Pavi&amp;#263;. And Huxley&apos;s Island still conferred with Rasselas about the wisdom of disturbing a utopia. (I try to maintain alphabetical order but I do not stack Classics separately.) At the bookshop, I had finally resorted to asking the assistant whether they stocked the book. She said they had nothing on their catalogue by Jean Paul except for Quintus Fixlein, in a translation by Carlyle. (This, really, was my first proof that Benjamin had not made up the author.) I was not surprised - Quintus Fixlein somehow sounds like a good model for Carlyle&apos;s tailor-philosopher Sartor Resartus; and I&apos;ve always considered Carlyle&apos;s prose to read like insufficiently translated German. There was also something domestic about this. At that time, my journey to work every morning took me past Carlyle&apos;s house on Cheyne Walk. As I walk past, I always admired its windows, subdivided into small panes of glass that caught the light and reflected it rosily. I wondered if it were the very same glass that Carlyle and his wife had looked through, with parallel, unhappy stares, in the silences of their life together.</div>

      <div>Why would my mind not let me get past that reference to Wutz? Did I feel that certain unease that follows the introduction to something new, that pale memento mori that there is yet another thing I do not know? Ars longa, vita brevis. Every unread book is a documentation of the life that goes on outside of us, of all those corners we will never turn. Did I feel slightly irritated because I did not get the joke?</div>

      <div>I imagined all those readers set against me, smiling with pleasure, smiling at the recollection. If this were a more dramatic story than one about a schoolmaster and his hobby, I might be telling you that the laughter gathered pace and volume, that when I lay my head on my pillow, the night was not darkness to me but glinting white teeth roaring with the appreciation of a joke I did not share, that - as there must always be a naïve third party to a joke, I became that third party, that what started out as a joke about a schoolmaster ended up being a joke about me, that like a character out of a Russian story, my life began to unravel, disintegrating, haunted by this simple reference which I did not get, that I wandered the streets of the city, queried people, made passing references to see if they got it - and that they all did, that in my dissolution I sought the comfort of women of the night, that as they re-hooked their stockings and lit their post-coital, they would snigger at the mention of that monosyllable, that hiccup, that phonetic glitch of a name, that street urchins &quot;remembered with pleasure&apos; the poor little schoolmaster Wutz, that other drunks in disreputable taverns sniggered at my drunken hiccups mistaking them for repeated mentions of the schoolmaster&apos;s name, that the volumes of his homemade library stacked up all around me, choking me in paper-dust, that from a distance, the schoolmaster himself chuckled half-pityingly at me, half-glad that there was now a decoy, a new butt, to the joke, foil. In reality, though, it was a mild curiosity that gnawed at me. I just thought it seemed like a good story and I wanted to read it. Having no German, I looked for a translation into English but none of the shops had it. And there was no mention of it in the catalogues. This seemed odd; why would a story referenced (briefly but intriguingly) in an extremely popular essay in Benjamin&apos;s most popular collection, which touches at some length on one of the most assiduously followed areas of Benjamin&apos;s interest (the nature of the collector) not be available in an English language translation? Considering the industry that has grown around Benjamin&apos;s thought, one would have imagined that such a translation would be part of the apparatus, freighted into the English language just as Benjamin&apos;s own essays have been.</div>

      <div>It also seemed one of those stories that would become beloved of commentators, used as an archetype of some literary syndrome or other, as Pierre Menard, Melville&apos;s Bartleby and The Man From Porlock have been. In fact, Benjamin&apos;s mention seems to be an attempt at minting the syndrome. (Generalised to the point of saying that every writer is, to some extent, Wutz - as Benjamin is doing. It seems to be always irresistible to generalise to this point.) Surely there must be many books written under related circumstances, that one hears of a book and is intrigued by the idea but then when one comes to read it finds out that the book is inferior to the one that had built up in his imagination in the meantime. Most of us feel this - some attempt to fill that gap with their own book, like extended mondegreens. Indeed, writing cannot really happen under any other circumstance so how come this reference did not capture anybody&apos;s imagination? Is it assumed that anyone who would want to read this story would know Enlish? But then why translate Benjamin in the first place? Perhaps there is a simple reason why there is no English translation available: there is nothing beyond the initial conceit.</div>

      <div>Whenever I&apos;m introduced to a new writer or a new horizon of knowledge. First, an excitement, a mild thrill that here is, possibly, a whole new universe waiting for me to explore. A writer whose ideas, whose voice, whose sequence of words may affect me as profoundly as some others, a few, have affected me. A new universe which may become part of mine, a new way of cutting the world, new cadences and rhythms that may possibly become part of the daily music of my mind. This is quickly followed by a mild embarrassment that I have been wasting my time, that I have been reading the wrong things, that everyone else seems to know these things. That &quot;many will remember with pleasure&quot; but not I. That had I taken different decisions in my life, had I channelled my mind differently, had I been more focused, I would know about Wutz, I would be among the smiling millions now, remembering with pleasure the large library which Jean Paul&apos;s poor little schoolmaster Wutz gradually acquired by writing, himself, all the works whose titles interested him in bookfair catalogues.</div>

      <div>Now this is precisely the sort of provincial reaction that Benjamin scoffs at. Sophisticated hommes de lettres like him do not feel that they have to read every interesting book that they hear about; they can sleep soundly with unread books, they can laze in front of unopened books. It is rather the autodidact, the earnest, the intellectually provincial, who break out in a sweat, who feel they have been rumbled, when they hear mention of a book they have not read. This, in fact, is part of the point Benjamin is making in his talk and may be the cause of his somewhat derisive tone. It is only the poor schoolmaster Wutz who - like Flaubert&apos;s Bouvard and Pecuchet, like Scriblerus - was under the illusion that the only thing that stood between him and omniscience was his provincial isolation and poverty, who believed that men in more leisurely circumstances, cultured men whose ranks he aspired to join, would simply send off for any book that took their fancy.</div>

      <div>Why could I not follow Benjamin&apos;s example? This &apos;talk&apos; that is exercising me is a perfect instruction in how to live calmly with unread books. I return to it, determined finally to get past that mention of Wutz. Benjamin starts off by describing his room full of freshly opened crates of books. Rather than remembering the hours of leisure he has spent reading them, or regretting the brevity of his life which will prevent him from reading them all, he comfortably lets his mind stray back to those cities in which he had acquired those books, each city being the architecture of acquisition. Once on the subject of acquisition, he mentions Wutz, who acquired his library by writing all the books himself. This time round I banish all incipient images of Romantic schoolmasters, of capes and mortar-boards and blackboards, of lamps and unbound sheets and quills and inkwells - and finally manage to get to the next line: &quot;Writers are really people who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.&quot; (And here I am, distracted from writing because of a book I do like but cannot buy.) This brought to mind a heroic act of reading my father had once performed. It was the 1950s and he had borrowed an American self-help book, a fairly good representation of the genre, with injunctions to Christianity and industry, anecdotes about heroically successful salesmen and coy references to uxoriousness. My father proceeded to type out a copy of the entire book and then hard-bind the pages into a volume, with a maroon coverleather-effect, a pseudo-book oozing verisimilitude, which now sits on my bookshelves. When I look at these pages, dimpled by the impact of the keys, I can hear the clatter of keys, in quick bursts interrupted by a thin bell and the zinging ratchet of the carriage being flung to the left. Considering the several weeks it took him to type out the book, and considering the fact that he had an established part-time occupation as a clockmaker, it should not have been difficult for him to calculate the opportunity cost of such an endeavour. However expensive the book might have been, the cost of paper, ink and binding, added to the hours he spent typing which he could have spent repairing clocks and watches would certainly have paid for the book several times over. (Efficiency has never been a great family trait. But maybe long-winded ways of acquiring books is.)</div>

      <div>Now when I came across Wutz, I was reading Benjamin to avoid writing. I read, as I do everything else, to avoid writing. (Writing is avoiding reading; living is avoiding writing.) It occurred to me that there is only one special case which justifies a reading of Jean Paul&apos;s own version of the story.</div>

      <div>The name Jean Paul could at first suggest a cultured, idle, French belletrist, perhaps much given to keeping a journal, accumulating aphorisms and maxims. [In the manner of Chamfort.] But Carlyle and Mahler&apos;s infatuation could certainly give me a particular impression about this Jean Paul. Here was a man who captivated the pompous Carlyle and drove him to select, of all his idol&apos;s qualities, the capacity to amuse even the most august of fictional tailor-philosophers. Now having Carlyle endorsing your sense of humour may well be - damning with - the faintest of praise. Mahler carried Jean Paul with him to his Romance, conflating him, in his music, with his great lost love. By now I had, at least, collated a brief biography from the odd fact surrounding each mention of Jean Paul. Johann Paul Friedrich Richter, this leading light of the Sturm und Drang movement, was born on that most equanimous of days, the vernal equinox, in 1763. Continuing the chain of affinity that came more easily in the Romantic age, Richter was greatly taken by Jean Paul Voltaire and changed his name accordingly in homage. This is a very humble act, more reminiscent of a provincial hairdresser than a literary titan.</div>

      <div>What would be Wutz&apos;s iconography? There is no place for the lion or the proto-cardinal&apos;s red hat. Jerome&apos;s paintings depict him as the anguished hermit, &apos;cursed&apos; with disliking what he read, &apos;cursed&apos; with retelling a story. Part of a series of minor works, or a Library of the Romantic movement, or Sturm und Drang, possibly funded by a German emigre, perhaps a descendant of Jean Paul&apos;s, another Richter, a third-generation immigrant who made millions on the stock market. Like Wutz, Jerome wrote - translated - because he could not find the book he wanted to read. The difference is that the book that Jerome wanted did not exist. These were the nights when Wutz found his adolescence again in the first hours of the night. In the book of his memories, his new life began with those nights, that first time he felt he was the only man awake. Then, as now, he could look down upon the village and see nothing but a dark hole, even on nights of full moon. As though the silver light could not reach that far. He would have seen, as a child, an hour or two earlier, the light in the parsonage go out. Now he did not feel, as he did when he was an adolescent, a great libertine for being up later than the pastor, greater even than Herr Kleist, who had a reputation in town for being something of a libertine, having been engaged, only briefly, as a much younger man to a woman from Paris. Now, as then, he looked down upon the towns - and the world - with a distant benevolence (lit. Condescension). He felt its protector and witness, that something indecent about watching someone sleeping. He fancied he could see impatient eyeballs darting about behind tightly shut lids. He imagined the city he never reached with its rowdy inns and (sophisticated) salons, its women, where men of opinion waged battle by pamphlet, its intrigues, its commerce, its learning, its libraries. More than ever, at these times when he watched the town, indecently, in its sleep, as though it had just flopped down onto the bottom of the hill, he could hear the town snoring.       </div>

      <div>I was reassured to confirm that he is not as generally well-known as these three when a few days later, reading Marcel Bénabou&apos;s Dump This Book While You Still Can, I came across the following paragraph: &quot;I even recalled the story (a true one, I&apos;ve been told) of the bookstore employee who one day found in his shop, high on a top shelf, among old German books forgotten there for ages, a volume of Jean-Paul (an author he had never read, but whose excessively short name. Intrigued him, and on whom he had taken, a priori, a sort of crush): he began to translate it, and the result at which he arrived seemed to him so fascinating that he immediately decided to devote the rest of his life to exploring other German Romantic writers, on whom he became the best-known specialist.&quot; This mention gladdened my heart. It helped to ease my embarrassment about not having heard of this Jean Paul before. If someone within anecdotal distance of Bénabou&apos;s acquaintance had not heard of Jean Paul, maybe this writer was not so well known after all. Maybe perfectly civilised people can walk this earth - or the streets of Paris, at least - ignorant of his existence; educated people, people who know people who know Marcel Bénabou. Conversely, though, it also began to confirm my suspicion that he is among that canon of safely referenced authors, that certain common pool of references, mostly European, not quite a canon perhaps but a sort of communion of saints [a canon is precisely that: a communion of sainsts] which normally also includes Montaigne, Lewis Carroll, Borges, perhaps Chamfort or Leopardi, Cervantes, a classical author or two, at least one source which the writer obsessively returns to, and another one which is wrongheaded but stubbornly referenced, perhaps Kipling or Stevenson or Chesterton or Jack London - usually a leftover from childhood, intellectualised after the fact) and a brace of writers from the author&apos;s second or third language. (As well as the exclusion of the most pertinent sources, whose invocation would dilute the necessity of the present work.) This canon, in the footnotes, acts as a bradella contextualising and wearing influences on their sleeve. A canon especially common to those writers who like to write books about books, belletrist, not quite academic, non-jargonistic.</div>

      <div>Sitting outside cafe near Valeries. A pale, blonde, woman walks past me slowly, left-to-right, she is out on a cigarette break. She frequently smiles to herself as she passes me, but not today. Seconds later, another woman, wearing white flannel trousers, a purple top and purple knickers, their lace  hem very precisely peeking out of the top of her trousers cycles past, right-to-left. I write a bit, for a few seconds, and read the bit about my father being a clockmaker [referenced]. I look up again and the cyclist whizzes past again, right-to-left and I see the smoker coming left-to-right. I look down,  look up, and the smoker is not there. Then, minutes later, the cyclist comes by again, right-to-left on a different bike, foldable,, giving her arse a different posture. I realise she was at the Evans bike shop trying out bikes. But did my impression of repetition trigger the vision of the smoker?</div>

      <div>There were many other factors in this decision. If, for instance, he read, as he once had, that a particular volume up for sale &quot;is perhaps the most beautiful book in existence&quot; he would certainly decide against its acquisition; a certain respect for the workings of plausibility prevented him. Although the library was in no way intended to deceive his visitors, he felt it ought to be a library in keeping with the rest of his person. And the Schoolmaster Wutz, though without doubt the most learned man in Auenthal, was a very modest person. In this respect, he was indecisive about which direction to exercise his considerable modesty: for to emphasise the fact that he had written the books himself was a kind of showing off, but to suggest that he had bought all these volumes was to brag about his riches - riches which he certainly did not possess. So, rather than being both a braggart and a dissembler, he chose to be just a braggart - though only in his own moderate way. He regretted these exaggerated blurbs because somehow he felt certain that they were depriving him of some perfectly handsome volumes which, were it not for the exaggerated salesmanship, his mind could quite comfortably have acquired. He felt that among these were many volumes his imagination actually could afford. Sometimes, through scrupulous browsing he would come across, in a different catalogue, a more restrained blurb for the same book and then went on to acquire it. He considered this fortuitous, and for days afterwards, he would walk around with the self-congratulating cunning smile of one who had [made] a bargain. And he proudly added the new volume to his ever-increasing library.</div>

      <div>Anyone in possession of more than a handful of books, who is in the habit of standing them up side by side on a shelf, must be prepared for the question, &quot;Have you read all your books?&quot; Fortunately, he is in possession of several books and if he has been lucky, may have stumbled over at least one of the many stock answers. Benjamin himself, his books not yet quite vertical in the essay which introduced me to Wutz, cites the example of [He says that he has hardly read any and cites Anatole France&apos;s retort to the &quot;philistine&quot; who asks him whether he has read all the books in his library. (&quot;Not one-tenth of them. I don&apos;t suppose you use your Sèvres china every day?&quot;)]. This strikes me as quite a feeble response and not really of any use to anyone whose books are not, by any description, volumes of occasion [d&apos;occasion]. The condemnation of philistinism is, however, gratifying. Wutz never used such a justification, because he considered his a working library. Umberto Eco quotes another one, &quot;Oh no, these are the ones I haven&apos;t read. I keep the ones I&apos;ve read in storage.&quot; [this is not an exact quotation] For Wutz, though, this question presented a serious problem. For what could he answer? He did not normally like to underline the fact that he had written all these books. Then he would have to get entangled in long-winded explanations. That he had not written them in the conventional sense, that is, this was not his oeuvre. Any reader who got as far as the frontispiece could surmise that. Wutz&apos;s dilemma, like his library, was far from conventional. If he admitted he had read them all, he could later be accused of false modesty, which Wutz rightly considered to be a cheap form of vanity. It had struck Wutz that Justine, and her uncle, may well ask him this impertinent question so he exercised himself considerably over it. So convinced was he that Justine would ask him the question that - now that he heard it issuing from her kind mouth - he had come to hold this quest, this question that had so vexed and frustrated him before whenever he heard other people ask it of, for instance, the pastor - as a valid enquiry. First in that it was valid for someone, upon seeing a library, to ask its owner about his intimacy with those volumes, just as a man introducing another would be thought deceptive if he did not clarify a relation. But he also became briefly interested in whether, as their writer, he could be said to have read those books. He found himself spending far too much time thinking about it and he wished he&apos;d find mention of a book about the justification of libraries so that his efforts could have a twin purpose. Although it was a question that irritated him so much. Before he had started accumulating his library, this was the question he fantasised about - it was the irritation that he aspired to earn. Forecasts of the evening started to crowd his mind, leaving no space for his books. He reasoned that it would be impossible for him not to mention the library, not to make it the centrepiece of the discussion. What else could he talk about?</div>

      <div>The book arrives. It&apos;s a short book, the length of a novella. I wasn&apos;t surprised, maybe I had already anticipated that it would be quite short, the story was like a one-liner, a joke, and I already knew the whole of it. Somehow, I couldn&apos;t imagine it running to a whole novel. Not because the subject matter itself could not support it but probably because of the way Benjamin had summarised the book, as a self-contained conceit.</div>

      <div>The T-square formed by my thumb and forefinger perfectly covers two sides of the rectangle formed by the book. It is five inches long and three and a half inches wide, with a bright matt yellow cover. The author&apos;s name is printed above the title in black serif letters justified to the right margin. The publisher&apos;s imprint is then printed below a bold black line which starting from above the left of the imprint title runs to the edge of the cover on the right. The imprint is in an identical typeface as the author&apos;s name and the book title, without any brand distinction or accompanying logo. The remaining three-quarters of the cover is blank, save for a few marks it has acquired from being carried around in my bag. There are twenty minute spots of ink, slightly smudged, as though a finger was run firmly over them, vertically from the bottom up. In total, none of these spots is larger than a couple of millimetres. The yellow patina has receded slightly at the top edge and the bottom right hand corner to reveal a more absorbent material which has absorbed some darker colours from its surroundings. The left-hand edge, at the binding, is raised by about half a millimetre, making it more vulnerable to wear. The back cover. Has the series name printed below a dark bold line which runs from the right-hand edge of the cover. At its right-hand point the line is aligned with the right-hand edge of the last word of the series name below it. Below it there is an unattributed quotation enclosed in chevron marks, Is it a quotation from the text itself, or perhaps the series&apos; motto - as with &quot;Go Everyman...&quot; justified with ragged margins to the right-hand edge of the series name and running for eight lines. At the bottom of the page there is the book&apos;s ISBN number in stylised, machine-readable, notation. (3-15-000119-6.). Below it is the book&apos;s barcode which incorporates the ISBN. Number. Next to the barcode is the price of the book (DM 3.00) to two decimal places. All this information is enclosed within a rectangle the bottom side of which is the bottom edge of the page, the three other sides are described by a thin black line. The rectangle is three-quarters of an inch high and two inches wide. A thick black line runs from the top left hand edge of the rectangle to the left-hand edge of the page, a distance of half an inch. The spine of the book is about five millimetres high. The author&apos;s name and the title are justified to the left hand margin and the number 119 to the right, in the same typeface as used on the front and back cover but in a smaller point size. The spine is just high enough to contain the letters, so that the top serifs of the letters begin to curve away towards the cover. The inside cover is a bright white without any print on it. The discoloration at the edges is more marked here but it only runs for about half a millimetre along the edges. In the gutter where the cover is attached to the rest of the book the glue seems uneven, punctuated by tufts of near-microscopic fibres peering out of it.</div>

      <div>The book&apos;s pages are of a matt light-sepia paper which catches the light from my desk lamp and absorbs it evenly, returning no glare. The author&apos;s name is at the top in small block capitals. Then, after three-quarters of an inch of blank space, the extended form of the title (&quot;Leben des vergnünten Schulmeisterlein Maria Wutz in Auenthal&quot;) is printed on three lines such that the shortened form of the title runs on a single, wider, line. The subtitle (&quot;Eine Art Idyll&quot;) is printed in small block capitals after half an inch of space. All the text on the frontispiece is centred. At the bottom of the page there is some more text in small block capitals and below it, after half an inch of space, the publisher&apos;s name. On the back of the frontispiece, at the top, there are five lines of text in a small point size. The lines are justified to both margins. The first four lines, which run to the right margin, all end in a hyphen (the third one is actually an em-dash. The last line consists of two syllables, orphaned from the line above it, and is centred. At the bottom of the page there are seven lines in the same small print, all centred. The text starts on the third page of the book - recto - without ceremony or any distinction in typeface. There is nothing to celebrate the first line of the text or the first page. The following forty-seven pages of the book, which contain the body of the text are identical in layout, with a few exceptions. The text is set between narrow margins of half an inch on either side and three-fourths of an inch top and bottom. Line numbers are indicated centred in the gutter, marking every fifth line. Each page contains thirty-seven lines each of which contains about ten words. The page number is indicated at the bottom of the page, aligned with the outside margin. The beginning of paragraphs is not marked by any indentation. The layout is nearly symmetrical, with two identical columns of line numbers, each flanked by a body of text, with the page number dangling from either edge. The letters of each word are bunched together so that the spacing between words is generous. The footprint of each word is substantially rectangular, since the words frequently start with a capital letter and contain vowels with umlauts. The regularity of this layout is seldom disturbed, except on two occasions when an indented quotation appears on its own paragraph and four instances when a footnote appears at the bottom of the page. Now the shadow of the left hand pages curved towards me falls on the gutter of the right-hand page, half-obscuring the line numbers, dividing them into differently illuminated tens and units. After the body of the text come thirteen pages printed in a point size that is three-quarters of the size of the body text. On the first page these are headed, in small block capitals, by the legend &quot;Anmerkungen&quot; The lines are justified to both margins. Each line begins with two numbers separated by a comma. Then comes a word or phrase in italics and then some lines in regular typeface. The last two pages of the book are laid out identically to the body text but in the point-size used for the preceding thirteen pages. The lines are not numbered. The last-but-one page is headed by the author&apos;s name in the small block capitals. The initials of the writer of this end-note are printed in lower-case italics and ranged to the right margin. I cannot find the full name glossing those initials anywhere. In total, the book consists of sixty-four pages. Is this ultimately the only honest translation possible?</div>

      <div>I pick up the book as I would pick up any other and instruct my eyes to follow the text; but unlubricated with recognition they fall in the crevices between one letter and the next. I can only look at these words, my eyes find no purchase. I am [look] like a cow staring at a palace. The mind, desperate perhaps to interpret the visual symbols, finds itself enunciating the letters and words, I resort to the mannerisms of the semiliterate, moving my lips and using my finger as cursor, guiding my eyes and mind. Looking at a text in a foreign language I don&apos;t have is a strange activity, a median point of activity. For an unsuccessful act of observation, there are many recognitions present. It is obviously a text, the book is immediately recognisable as such. (How alien would a language have to be for it not to be recognisable as such?) It is obviously a sequence of letters which I recognise. I even happen to know the letters since they are in the Roman alphabet. I even know, approximately, the sounds that the letters represent in their syllables. In fact, I can interpret the text as a vocal score. As far as the text is a visual document of the sounds, I can read it out aloud and reinterpret it, if only as obliviously as a stylus dipping and bobbing over a gramophone record, following the varying amplitude of the groove. In this sense I can function as a serviceable reader. If, say, I were to telephone a German friend, I could read her passages from Schulmeisterlein Wutz for her entertainment. I could offer to baby-sit German children and put them to bed with the adventures of the poor little schoolmaster Wutz. I could find employment as a reader to a bedridden blind German and read them the entire story. They would probably laugh at my accent and ultimately find the indifferent cadence of my ignorant vocalisation quite unbearable but - if such an emergency were to arise - I could function as a fairly useful mechanical reader. My cognition ceases at the level of letter combination. This is a very specialised form of ignorance. That I can recognise this thing to such a low level and then suddenly cease to make sense while I pass through that level, like passing through a sheet of fog, of letter-sequence is quite remarkable. Because there is nothing in what I am looking at that I do not recognise, except the sequence of the letters. These glyphs, simple and familiar in themselves, are put together [juxtaposed] in such a way as to have a disturbing effect. My pupils dart as they fix on recognisable letters but then wobble as they see the unfamiliarity of the associations [between letters] My eyes, finding no purchase, slide over to the margins. It is an oppressive, physiological effect, like op-art. After several attempts a sensation like snow-blindness [earlier, mention glare] sets in, my eyes can only see within the narrow tunnel of the width of a letter, as soon as my glance widens to take in the adjacent letter my mind is clouded. Approaching the text I can make sense of it, I recognise it as a book, and then as a prose text, a novella. I can distinguish paragraphs and sentences and make out their division into words.</div>

      <div>The story is trapped in its German, under Nimrod&apos;s spell. It would be coy, however, to treat the book as though I could avoid &apos;reading&apos; it. My eyes are drawn in, to overheard words, to seductive digraphs. I could, at the very least, sub-read it, or pre-read it. All the apparatus is clear to me, even by its mere placement. Most of the above, I managed to glean merely from the placement of text in its conventional setting. The frontispiece announces &apos;Mit Anmerkungen und einer Biographischen Notiz&apos; Although I had stuck to the spirit of this exercise and frozen all further acquisition of German, it would be coy to pretend bafflement at these notices. Sure enough, at the back, above a row of short, numbered paragraphs there is the legend Anmerkungen. The numbering system is simple enough to follow. Each enumeration is expressed in two numbers separated by a comma. Only the semi-literate would fail to make the correspondence of the first number with the page number and the second number with the line number. And, as if such a system were designed for me, the word presently being glossed is repeated in italics. This quickly confirms my estimation of the way this system works. (Numbering systems expressed in digits are the closest we get to a universal language. This is almost relevant - because here we have a perfect reference/referee system.) endnotes (incomprehensible notes glossing incomprehensible text [get back to this later - the text and the notes correspond over my head, exchanging in-jokes knowing references, glossing and referencing each other over my head]) and a brief biographical note of two pages. It seems to be some sort of school revision series. It is a paper-bound volume in a bright but matt yellow, very much like an old-fashioned thrille. Otherwise a purer description above would have spoken simply of black marks of ink on white paper, making the description a parody of chosism. It is only the questions that really rise above the abstract greyness of the page. The question marks pull up the sentence, like a kite pulling up its tail, addressing me with unspecified interrogation. The sentence becomes animated [buoyed - kite metaphor]; though still meaningless it is humanised, given a voice. In my role as bedside reader, it would be these sentences that I could pronounce most intelligently. The other recognisable devices of punctuation do not give life to the text in the same way, they are mere stops and starts. The quotation marks, chevrons as per continental practice, only have a mild effect in animating the text braced within them. But the question marks face me with abstract interrogation, like the narrowed eyes and slightly furrowed brow of the questioning glance. In their silence, they seem more desperate, vulnerable - a message of empathy to my ignorance. The interrogative sentences come in series of three or four every now and again [check this] It is these rhetorical questions, these gestures towards an empty space of possibility, these lacunae of narrative, unresolved even in the original text, that I can read most clearly. All the questions are rhetorical to me since I don&apos;t know whether the text goes on to answer them.</div>

      <div>In fact the text, bewildering as it is, is not silent. It coruscates with such familiar devices; it rages with half-recognized words, evocative noises and decipherable constructions. It is crowded with faces I recognize, friends true and false. When I received the book, the first new information I obtained was the full title. &quot;Leben des vergnünten Schulmeisterlein Maria Wutz in Auenthal - Eine Art Idylle.&quot; &quot;Leben des&quot; I am almost certain means &quot;life of&quot; and it would make sense there. It might mean &quot;loves of&quot; but I doubt it. I have no idea what &quot;vergnünten&quot; means. Now, I would have thought that schoolmaster would be Schulmeister, following various loan words like kappelmeister etc, so &quot;Schulmeisterlein&quot; is an obviously modified form of the word. I think the safest guess would be the diminutive form, also justifying the translated quotation of Benjamin&apos;s &quot;the poor little...&quot; There is the possibility, though, that this &quot;-lein&quot; ending is the feminine form of the word as in, say, X-X. I briefly entertain the schoolmaster as a woman. This would certainly make sense of the name &quot;Maria&quot; Why wasn&apos;t Benjamin&apos;s quote then translated as Schoolmistress? I check the date of the translation and confirm that it came from a time when the fashion for neutralizing gender by using the masculine form, especially for professions, had not yet taken hold. But I think this is unlikely, the name &quot;Maria&quot; for Catholic men is not unheard of, especially in more Latin countries, although it is usually propped up by a reassuringly masculine name like Joseph or John. Looking at Benjamin&apos;s mention again, I see he explicitly says &quot;he couldn&apos;t afford to buy them&quot;.</div>

      <div>Surely it can be translated - why hasn&apos;t it been? The text is mysterious to me, but would it retain its mystery if I had German? After all, many bilingual readers, professional translators even, must have been aware of its existence, of the possibility of translating it and yet resisted the temptation. Is there something in the text itself that guards against its translation, something I can&apos;t see? Maybe it&apos;s an in-joke, shared by German... Or perhaps a heart-rending plea, begging, for whatever reason, not to translate. Perhaps woven into the text, wrapped as it is in Nimrod&apos;s spell, is a booby-trap in order to keep it in its original German. There may well be countless translators reduced to babbling idiots after having tried to translate it. [cf glossolalia - see how bible says it] There may even be an explicit curse on its traducers, tagged onto the end of the story. At the end of Revelations, there is an explicit curse against adding and subtracting to the words. &quot;If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.&quot; This is the pound of flesh [look up advocate&apos;s response], a challenge, a condition impossible to fulfil as translator since paraphrase and circumlocution are the only devices that make the illusion of equivalence possible. Unravelling those words would cause a curse to be activated. Raining down abominations, as soon as the first shaft of vulgate penetrates [here invoke the language of the reformation]. This (and any other) justification may well become absurd as the meaning of the story emerges - begins to form before me - Wutz may have admonitions in store for me, solid counter-arguments, sobering cautionary tales hidden within those umlauts etc. Perhaps he addresses just this very issue.</div>

      <div>I am shrinking away from an obvious possibility, that the text could never be translated. Where does this a priori faith, this optimistic superstition, in its translatability come from? Is it a lazy extrapolation from the fact that I know that all other texts seem to be translatable? The condition of effability that we assume for all languages is not a condition binding on languages but one that binds things. A language is said to be able to express everything, in however circumspect a manner, except the name of God. Just as it is ineffability that &apos;defines&apos; God, it is effability that defines things. What are the things described in Jean Paul&apos;s story?xx.</div>

      <div>REMEMBER: discuss cryptanalysis here. And other possible methods of translation - Linear B.] Can there be things that exist in German but do not exist in English? [Either go farther than Steiner et al or don&apos;t go at all.] Now &apos;untranslatable&apos; is an appellation that is commonly applied to many (if not all) texts. All nations like to flatter themselves that their quintessential words are untranslatable. The Portuguese with their famous and baffling saudad (etc). The jokes, especially. The mysterious process of translation has been likened to one of Zeno&apos;s paradoxes (Eco) - it should not work, it is a linguistic [or philosophical?] scandal. But just as, pace Zeno, Achilles is ahead of the tortoise with the first spring of his limbs, so Dante&apos;s eschatological drama is very much present in the English language and Shakespeare in the Italian. There are men and women of all nationalities who would feel affronted by the suggestion that the English language has any special claim on Shakespeare. The distant epic of Gilgamesh outstrips the shell of its Sumerian. Finnegan walks the streets of Dublin (or whatever it is he actually does) in Italian, French, German. Why can&apos;t Wutz collect his library in English? Why can&apos;t he follow his mania in English? Merely invoking Locke&apos;s sobering caution [was it Locke or Hume?] that the truth is that which it would be hypocritical to deny, then it is &apos;true&apos; that translation &apos;works- even if unsightly quotation marks may well have to contain anything it produces, and most of what is said about it. Anything said about translation is either banal or mystical, frequently both. (Quine said something quite similar.).</div>

      <div>The translator is possibly the only reader who has written proof of having read a book, his translation is a receipt of his reading, a counterfoil. Editors and publishers may go with books on the strength of the first few lines or the reputation of the writer, typesetters, printers and binders may bring it to life quite obliviously, reviewers may judge it by the cover, retailers may sell it indifferently and readers buy it only to leave it languishing on their shelves. Even the author himself may have written it in a daze, or in a stupor of inspiration merely taking dictation from their muse. But the translator has line-by-line proof of having read it. This document of at least one reading is also proof that the book can be read all the way through, that nothing happens to upset the viability of the text as a readable document - although, of course, the translation has to be read through for it to count in this sense. (cf. &apos;viability&apos; of text outside of the author&apos;s mind.) This is the position once occupied by scribes. How many books are now &apos;read&apos; only by Gutenberg&apos;s machines? Does the translator automatically endorse a work by choosing to translate it - can we infer approval? Or, like the hapless interpreter...? It is not merely for the practical purpose of translation that we expect the translator to have read the original text. His very embarkation on such an arduous task, this line-by-line endorsement, is comprehensive. Although translators, literary and otherwise, are as much bound to the pecuniary grindstone as the rest of us, we may (however wrongly) assume that his choice of source is far more deliberate than many another&apos;s. While the rest of the publishing machinery is bound to schedules and balance-sheets, the translator has the time to sit back and actively choose which book to translate. [adoption v. Giving birth, friends/relatives] For the writer may naïvely and in good faith set out to write his best book but the translator has the advantage of hindsight. Unlike the author himself, unlike the reader, he knows where the book is going. The author&apos;s good faith comes from his writing it at all - it is the book which, even in the most mundane of circumstances, he cannot help but write. [This needs to be parallel with Wutz as Reader, Writer - also, we have dealt with the reader as writer and the writer as reader ... Jerome, too] The translator here is seen as a special kind of writer - and we expect a good faith from him which we do not even expect from the author. While we may imagine a book contemptuously written, it is harder to imagine a book translated in such spirit. As an importer of an exotic delicacy is suggesting that it is worthwhile getting your dates from Jerusalem, the translator is implicitly justifying the transport of the work from the foreign language, justifying the linguistic trauma on the source and target languages, the source and target texts. Justifying this preposterous feat, etc... Indeed, as soon as a book has negotiated the various filters which the publishing industry employs to protect us from the mediocre, the uncommercial, the unfashionable, the unreadable, the barely literate, the deranged tracts that will end up at the vanity publisher&apos;s desk - another set of filters wrap themselves around this new work - those that will determine whether it gets translated. And then, if a book embarks on a second round of translation, it is well on the way to becoming a classic. (Insofar as the translator is as subject to pecuniary constraints as the rest of us, let us here extend the translator to mean the entire publishing apparatus that brings us the work from a foreign language to one we can read.) Indeed, in that most conventional of literary forms, the preface, an author is expected to be humble about his own work (sometimes to the point of flippancy), a translator is expected to be humble about his own translation, but he is also expected to be not merely courteous but positively full of admiration of his source material. Prefaces along the lines of &apos;I have chosen to translate this text and thereby to rescue it from its native mediocrity&apos; are rare. A new translation, modifies, becomes part of the protocol of exchange between two languages. Modifies the tentative mapping of one universe into the cartography of another. (The writer, who delivers his work from oblivion to the text, whose source material is oblivion, is given a speculative licence... if the merchandise turns out to be faulty, well, how was he to know? But the translator is allowed no such margin. He knew very well what he was embarking on.) A translation gives the original a certain canonicity (as the notorious transport of a book to a film - suddenly the book achieves a Platonic splendour - &quot;It&apos;s not as good as the book.&quot; And this even when the book itself was never anything more than a treatment for a film, and the sooner it was redeemed by the camera the better.) The sheer labour of the task indicates a certain commitment. The translator is the runner from Marathon [what was his name?], who absorbs the message, runs the twenty-four miles from one language to another, then, exhausted, dies - transparent and anonymous - as he presents us with the author&apos;s work. The translator, a privileged confidant of the author&apos;s, has conspired (consorted) with the author in their own language, then emerges to tell us what has been said in that intimate encounter, the conclave of their secret language. A translation is an account of a reading. The translator is the writer as reader. In this sense, Wutz is the anti-translator. He is the reader as writer . And this is my problem here, with this scandalous translation. For even if I were humbly to refrain from offering my translation for others, even if I do not implicitly recommend it to others, I can scarcely decide whether it is worth translating it for my own use. I have no data on which to base my decision. Ars lunga vita breve, as Faust laments - I need to ascertain whether the task is worthwhile, whether there is something more to the story than the charming conceit of a man who sets out to write every book he wishes to possess. Then comes the thin layer of my bafflement, the sequence of the letters. Once I plough through that I am once again in a familiar world, that of letters, among their conventional strokes and junctions, ascenders, descenders, serifs and counters. I can only really bear to see the page as a whole [or up close, my nose to the paper], its greyness is slightly unfamiliar, darker than usual. This is no doubt due to the more frequent use of initial capitals and umlauts. The edition I have is not perfectly typeset and more than ever I notice undesirable rivers of white paper, as though the book had been left out in a rain of emptiness. The serifs try to guide me on, from one letter to another but my eyes never quite take flight. There is no continuity between one letter and another.</div>

      <div>Books in translation are better. If well translated, the weave is more complex, better texture. Gets the text out of the writer&apos;s claustrophobia. (Perhaps) just as, say, Stravinsky was a notoriously mediocre conductor of his own music, a writer may not be the best person to write his own books. Leopardi said, &quot;Even the most beautiful and valuable writings, when their own author is reciting them, become such as to kill with boredom.&quot; Perhaps we can go one further [we can actually start paragraph with this]. Translation can act as a filter, liberating the text from the devices of its language, semantic froth, decanting the narrative into a new vessel, a sort of baptism of fire. It can act as a Brechtian V-Effect. [Verfremdungseffekt. What was the point of the V-effect? Use definition or function rather than name?] A translated text is a public text, does not come straight from the writer&apos;s solitude, is more ethnographic [in Eliot&apos;s sense], is more complexly secured (as if with scaffolding and guy ropes and girders) since there is the source language&apos;s mapping between words and things, the target language&apos;s, as well as the established protocol of equivalence between the two languages. [Wittgenstein&apos;s Second Philosophy may be relevant here, re: public and private language.] Translation is ratification, a proof of viability, that the text is not merely the writer&apos;s own hallucination... The scientific-method principle of repeatability [look up properly] Reading an account of a reading. Chewed cud (mother/baby). Royal tasters... Well, if it didn&apos;t kill the translator, then it&apos;s safe to read, the miner&apos;s canary.</div>

      <div>The first apparent problem of such an a priori translation - or rather, the foremost of a phalanx of problems which immediately present themselves - is one of personal endorsement. It may be assumed, whenever we are presented with a translated text, that the translator - in some way or other - endorses the original, that he thinks it is worthwhile not only for him to translate the text but also for us to read it. (For the sake of this argument, a clear distinction between an original work and its translation is being drawn. Also, these remarks are mostly relevant only to literary translation.) Which is to say, by translating this work I will be endorsing it. I will be asserting my moral right to be identified as an endorser of this book. However, whether the work is worth translating, whether I would want to back it, will only become clear to me as I unravel the &apos;meaning&apos; of the text. This preoccupation may seem somewhat lazy of me, why don&apos;t I just go ahead and translate it? If it turns out to have been worth the hassle then I will show it to others. If not, then I will leave it buried. But I am here following a Wutzian impulse, if not the letter of it, then the spirit. Ars lunga, vita brevis. The literary world is rife with scandals of fiery reviewers who have not read their subject, critics unacquainted with the object of their derision, authorities unfamiliar with their subject, established writers who trot out a helpful, enthusiastic but ignorant blurb for a friend or an agency stable-mate. We know to take all such recommendations lightly, because men must earn their living and veniality is to be shown compassion in literature as in everything else. But a translator&apos;s endorsement is taken more seriously because the least that is expected of a translator is that he has read the original. (Even the author may be forgiven not having read his own book, as indeed, in some ways, he may never do. For we may like to imagine the author writing in an extended trance.).</div>

      <div>My only data, though it comes from eminent pens, is scant. First, Benjamin in Unpacking My Library. Let us look at that short mention again. &quot;Of all the ways of acquiring books, writing them oneself is regarded as the most praiseworthy method. At this point many of you will remember with pleasure the large library which Jean Paul&apos;s poor little schoolmaster Wutz gradually acquired by writing, himself, all the works whose titles interested him in bookfair catalogues; after all, he could not afford to buy them.&quot; First, the mild tremor of my embarrassment at being unfamiliar with a reference which he assumes many in the audience will get, an embarrassment assuaged only by Benjamin&apos;s subsequent, tactful gloss. There is little qualitative judgement to go on here. Firstly, that Benjamin would choose to reference Wutz at all may have some small significance. Jean Paul&apos;s company in the same talk is certainly eminent, co-referees include... The most significant word, for our purpose here, is &quot;pleasure&quot; - a weighted one to be sure. Benjamin expects us to remember &quot;with pleasure&quot; Prima facie, this would appear to be a recommendation of the story. That is still not a recommendation of the story itself - it is only a recommendation of the premiss. I am of course, at this point, beyond need of confirmation of the seductive nature of the idea. But the associations we are here expected to make of the idea, the very wording &quot;remember with pleasure&quot; does seem to suggest that Jean-Paul has drawn such a charming picture of his toiling schoolmaster that we will remember him with human warmth. (Unless the pleasure of remembering comes merely from the fact of remembering at all, a knowing grunt which we may imagine sounding in that lecture hall - or radio talk - by those who shared the great man&apos;s references, akin to the knowing guffaws that some theatre-goers affect at Elizabethan jokes. But we may assume Benjamin to be above such coquetry.).</div>

      <div>Another passing reference comes in Hannah Arendt&apos;s introduction to the same volume. &quot;...everything &apos;that is said from the angle of the true collector&apos; is bound to appear as &apos;whimsical&apos; as the typically Jean Paulian vision of one of those writers &apos;who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.&apos;&quot; This is a mysterious reference. In the most straightforward (and honest) interpretation of these words, Arendt seems to be suggesting that such a view is typical of Jean Paul. (And that this story is not typical of Jean Paul since in it, according to Benjamin, we have exactly the opposite case: a writer who &quot;gradually acquired by writing, himself, all the works whose titles interested him in bookfair catalogues; after all, he could not afford to buy them.&quot;) Is all of Jean Paul&apos;s work, then, concerned with this theme? How can this theme be made generic? A less honest interpretation would be that &apos;typically&apos; here means not &apos;as is a type, a characteristic of&apos; but a type usually considered Jean Paulian. Hesitating to assume carelessness in Arendt, is there any significance in the fact that she calls this not a Wutzian but a Jean Paulian vision? Or is it just a synecdoche too far? When such eponyms appear in general language they can tend to happen according to apparently haphazard rules. Synecdochical. &apos;Orwellian&apos; is usually taken to mean &apos;characteristic of a dystopian vision of a totalitarian state&apos; Obviously, this vision is not really characteristic of Orwell - it is only derived from one of his books. &apos;1984ian&apos; however, would be an infelicitous construction, both typographically [syntactically? Orthographically] and euphonically. &apos;Nineteeneightyfourian&apos; is hardly better, even if it begins to approach concrete poetry. &apos;Orwellian&apos; would perhaps more accurately describe an action which is peculiarly both progressively socialist and nostalgically English. On the other hand, we say &apos;Quixotic&apos; rather than &apos;Cervantian&apos; even though the Quixote represents a far larger proportion of Cervantes&apos; work (and the totality of his popular work in English) than 1984 does of Orwell&apos;s. Similarly we say Homeric, Dantesque and Kafkaesque. Shakespearean can mean almost anything. Secondly, she suggests that this &apos;typical&apos; vision is of writers &apos;who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.&apos; We have been led to believe that Wutz is certainly not one of these writers. [here is another opportunity for building our Wutz story] Our poor schoolmaster, on the contrary, labours under no such affectation. &quot;He could not afford to buy them,&quot; Benjamin unambiguously assures us. He is a reluctant writer - he is only a reader. As his pupils are released back into the village streets, as they disappear off back to their mothers, and their animals and their catapults, and their puberty, Wutz&apos;s thoughts settle peacefully over his bookfair catalogues. His pen is the water-douser&apos;s rod, attempting some telepathic communion with the writers of those titles [maybe he&apos;s mindful of the intentionist fallacy - he is, in some ways, an anti-intentionist avant la lettre]. What I am looking for, I suppose, is an unambiguous reassurance that my venture is worth the trouble, something along the lines of , &quot;As Jean Paul says in his brilliant novella Schulmeisterlein Wutz (sadly not yet available in English translation) which goes against its initial conceit...&quot; The one thing we do not get is an unambiguous endorsement of the story. Nobody says &apos;as Jean Paul says in his brilliant short story...&apos; or, the &apos;Wutz, that exquisitely depicted schoolmaster in Jean Paul&apos;s...&apos;.</div>

      <div>By deciding not to retain the same number of capital letters, we bid farewell to any hope of equivalent surface area. Our English language text will now, necessarily, use a different amount of ink (more). Our faith in equivalence of the two texts must now therefore shift, it is a leap of faith. [Wittgenstein image problem: similarity can be shown but not spoken of.] We have now truly entered the realm of language. Our two anagrammatised texts displace the same amount of white space, they have the same density [find the precise term in physics re flotation of ships]. In very real terms they are using the same (measurable) volume of ink , covering the same acreage. (Here we can become as interested in this as someone applying gold-leaf for whom such calculations would have very pragmatic consequences. Are there less utterances in German inscribed in gold leaf?) The relationship between our two texts is therefore thus: they are the same amount of matter differently formed, reshaped clay. Same weight, same albedo.</div>

      <div>Each word, as I write it, is makeshift ... more so than usual. (because I&apos;ll have to see later if it fits the anagram, and anything I insist on keeping will have to pay its price... as I write this I am confident that the anagramatisation can be done but anything that works towards making it possible may also erase this explicit expression of this hope, etc. Also, the process of achieving this anagram is influencing my description of it here, and therefore my thinking of how it may be achieved. Also, the &apos;reality&apos; of the text is influencing the truth of what my description of it here. The game modifies its own rules - or rather its own execution - much like Mornington Crescent [there is a mathematical term for this process... nomic, I think.]).</div>

      <div>Translation is a debt incurred in one currency, repaid in another. But never fully repaid; many things have to be paid in kind. [TRACE - Who said this?] We are here using a different currency but somehow contriving to use the same denominations. This is a clear image of the distortion - the bravura aspect, if you will. It&apos;s like converting $15.67 not into GBP15.67 but into the market equivalent of $15.67 [for figure use number of characters] but still using a tenner, a fiver, a 50/100 piece, a 10/100 piece, a 5/100 piece and a 2/100 piece. (Obviously, we could also be demonstrating the fallacy of our translation because really we&apos;ve just translated it into GBP15.67.).</div>

      <div>FROM WUTZ&apos;S METHOD TO OUR ANAGRAM] The two texts have, hypothetically an identical numerical value. What affinity arises from this? If we look at the affinity inferred by Jewish mystics from (Jesus=Fish). Thus, the fish is to Jesus as our English text is to the German original. There are various objections to this: 1) These are not Hebrew letters, not noumenal - you can&apos;t just go borrowing techniques while refuting its foundational tenet. Fashionable as it has been, there really is a limit to the coherence of any secular statements founded on the Torah. 2) Only makes sense if underpinned by faith that the letters themselves are the building blocks of God&apos;s creation. Kabalistic notion of the Torah as an anagram of the perfect Torah - also (very important) one tradition that holds that the imperfections of the world we live in exist because a scribe missed out one single letter of the Torah (since the Torah is noumenal and the universe a mere description of the Torah).</div>

      <div>When his three students had gone back to their mothers, and as the sun was already beginning to set, Wutz would start his long, slow climb back up to the house. It is a small house with a large front room, a kitchen beside it, and two bedrooms upstairs. Although the house belonged to his grandfather, who built it himself when he first arrived here from Wittenberg, this has always been a temporary arrangement for Wutz. He never had that resigned, perhaps affected regard which country people especially are supposed to posses for their residence. The soil beneath his feet was never the soil that nourished him, it was rather, he felt, a sponge, its absorbency sapping his vitality, its fecundity choked him and surrounded him with brooding noise. As a young man, he dreamt of leaving Auenthal behind him and seeking employment in one of the Royal courts. Then, when he was 35 the old schoolmaster retired and it was assumed that Wutz would take over, and also take over the lodgings that came with the school. This rested on the assumption that the old schoolmaster would expire before long. But there he still was living upstairs. Not that anyone ever saw him or heard from him but his sister visited once or twice a week and if she had ever turned up to find him dead, she had never told anybody. There were rumours that she had smuggled out the body, that he was still there like Ines de Castro, offering sibling. Wutz never bothered to enquire. In any case, to Wutz, his grandfather&apos;s house had certain advantages. No-one bothered him up here.</div>

      <div>His walk down the hill was less meditative. It always reminded him of that last walk down, with his grandfather, then his grandmother, then his father, then, after many years - alone, his last walk down with his mother. That was the first time he had walked down the hill alone. In the mornings before that, he would always be accompanied by his mother or father or one of his grandparents, going down to the town on their own business. Now his family lay at the bottom of the hill, like shipwrecks [mermaids again] He heard the song calling him down and knew he could not resist much longer. Every time he walked down, he wondered whether he would ever walk up again. Would anyone take the trouble to take him back up the hill and march him down formally, who would it be? Justine? [His chief interest in Justine seems to be not walking down the hill alone, especially that last time. And for someone to bequeath the books to.] - or would he go to the bottom, founder, with his eyes wide open? And what would become of his library? He had no-one to bequeath it to. The house will be let out and its new tenants will clear it out - along with his old furniture. Perhaps there would be a lover of books in the new household, a young son perhaps, still unworldly and fond of solitude. But what would he make of it? Would his green enthusiasm congratulate the late tenant and adopt him as a posthumous mentor or would the untested perfectionism of his youth scoff at Wutz&apos;s rustic ambition and timid imagination, perhaps filling him with revulsion for the provincialism that surrounds him and spurring him on to leave for the cities Wutz had never reached? When he thought of this [subjunctive] acolyte of his, Wutz almost immediately felt protective and jealous. [****** Wutz walking up and down the hill inevitably calls Sisyphus to mind. Blend it in well.].</div>

      <div>It took him about half an hour to climb the hill. This was not on account of his age; it had always taken him that long. As a child, with the questions trigerred by his observations of the society at the foot of the hill frowning his brow, he would converse with imaginary friends and adults, positing questions which he imagined would confound even adults. His favourite story from the Bible was that of Jesus discussing scripture with the elders. [What is the standard name of this episode?] He longed for some festival [or was it another census?] in [Mainz] which his parents would be obliged to attend. In this fantasy, he would then tarry at [Mainz], and visit the Count who would be astonished at his understanding and answers. He would then be discovered to have noble ancestry in reality. But his parents never went away, and he couldn&apos;t imagine them taking him with them.</div>

Then, as he climbed the hill he made order of his memories and impressions, this was his waking dream time.

      <div>In any case, Wutz was never very enthusiastic about seeing Vogel. Years ago, they had formed a strong friendship and it was, indeed, through the bookseller that Wutz had embarked on his project. They had spent many evenings poring over catalogues together. The bookseller rarely had any real books to show since he seemed to conduct most of his business by proxy. Vogel would show him some catalogue which had just been mailed to him and together they would let the terse descriptions work on their imagination.</div>

      <div>While Vogel would be estimating its worth, drawing up a list of clients who might be interested in such a Volume, images of the book and its possible contents would exercise Wutz. Once they came across the description of a small pamphlet, described as a &quot;polyglottal infusion&quot; by which the Walloons could acquire a knowledge of low-German in six weeks. This, to Vogel, seemed preposterous and he mentioned that he had a niece from Binche, whom he saw on his travels now and then, who could not speak a word of German. [No, he mentions her now for the first time.</div>

      <div>Wutz said this was perhaps the perfect opportunity to instruct her in the German language but Vogel showed no interest in acquiring the pamphlet. At first he said it would probably be very expensive, and when Wutz arched an eyebrow at him, as though to disapprove of this lack of gallantry he was showing towards his niece, Vogel improvised that the fact that she spoke no German gave a certain spiritual air to their relations and, in any case, he had sufficient French to fulfill any duty of instruction he had towards his niece, Justine. Wutz found this unsatisfactory and could not tear his mind away from an imagined reconstruction of the pamphlet to aid Justine in acquiring a knowledge of German in six weeks. He dwelt on the words &quot;polyglottal infusion&quot; and tried to imagine what such a document would look like. It sounded as though it were something that worked by suggestion and total immersion, a bouquet garni of grammar and vocabulary that the student would acquire without really noticing. The description of this item also mentioned that it was a mere forty-five pages long, and not bound in rigid covers [this should go in the beginning]. A few thousand words in a [semi-]permeable structure, uncontained, that would osmotically transfer the language they contained into the mind of the inquisitive Walloon. What words would be required? Wutz asked himself. Those most indicative of the use of the language, archetypes of syntax and declension? Was it a completely artificial exercise which, after the instruction, would be removed and discarded? Or, probably far more useful, those words most commonly used in daily speech - but surely that would depend on the young Justine&apos;s station in life. It would be of no use to her, for instance, to obtain a large lexicon of agricultural words if the young Justine were a townswoman. Nor would it be useful giving her much court language if, as he assumed, the bookseller&apos;s niece belonged to the commercial classes. But it was that permeable, soft, unbound, nature of the book that formed most readily in his mind As though such a generous open weave was itself allowing what was in it to seep into him. Where Justine was distant and mysterious, with a mysterious role and mysterious needs, this blushing Walloon as he imagined her, suffering her uncle&apos;s barely adequate French exertions, was cased in impenetrable skin. From this distance he could not see her. So he imagined Justine through the words she would need to use. [subtler, subtler] He started with the various salutations that a woman of her station would require in society, all the formal greetings to merchants and bishops and minor diplomats. Then several sentences that allowed her to explain her circumstances, her place of birth, her family. Through the tenses of the verbs he saw her actions, perfect and continuous, he saw her acting on things and people; lone, ruminative gerunds, imperatives gently delivered, and subjunctives that did not bring her to him. Nouns received, belonged, were acted upon or just existed as names in her world, as they travelled down the pole of declension. He saw Justine dative and Justine ablative. Her life was daisychained, dovetailed, finewoven [mselli] with prepositions and participles, these were the insubstantial abstracts of her life.</div>

      <div>Having made his appointment, Wutz considered it prudent to [visualise] the evening and prepare himself, to ensure an agreeable evening for the bookseller and his niece. He would offer to collect them at their home and walk with them up the hill. He was certain they could find it, even though he doubted they had ever been to the top of his hill. There was little here to bring them. The bookseller would probably decline but he would repeat his offer. If the bookseller accepts, he would make sure that [Frau XXX/his mother/sister - later, mention something mysterious about her] had everything ready before she left for the day. A simple meal that would require little ceremony. He would not come back home after school but go to their house direct. On the way up he would explain why he chose to live in the ugliest spot in Auenthal. He would give modest reasons without sounding defensive or too [much a loner] or dour. Perhaps he ought to emphasise it was his grandfather&apos;s house and he felt it was his home. He would also need to explain why he does not insist he take the school house, which was rightfully his. The bookseller and his daughter probably knew that the two rooms atop the school were by right his, and they probably knew that no one had seen the old schoolmaster for the last fifteen years. Would Justine expect him to assert his dues in a manly fashion or would she appreciate his kindness in not confronting the old schoolmaster&apos;s sister, a woman who was herself quite old?</div>

      <div>The project had contrived to weary his mind with practical questions, that it may find it well ploughed [tilled] for the graver matters. The first question that exercised him was whether the work he was supposed to reform was to be in the Italian first hand of its poet or in second hand, in the German of its translators. By what clairvoyance would he obtain the text in German? Who would come now to take him by the hand, the author or his translator? For if the text were in the ideas, in the rumours he had heard, then surely the images that would form before him would be in Italian. Would he be able to take them down, oblivious to their meaning? Wutz smiled at this idea. That would be the final refinement of his method, one which he felt, had not been reserved for this world. So he walked through dark woods, went round in circles, passed through canyons and chained monsters, spoke to lovers and schemers, unrepentant sinners. He saw the words before him, clearly enumerating their biographical depravity and their punishment. His mind seemed reluctant to read those words, ingeniously arranged, as he had known, in tercets. His own life had been timid in comparison, and had all men lived as he had done, the pages of mythology would be blank. [There certainly would have been nothing for another Wutz to imagine.] Against Loyola&apos;s warning, Wutz pressed his faculties into the service of imagining also the deeds that had earned those poor wretches their eternal fate, his mind contorted under the weight of damning human actions, and on this late night, he felt a twinge for possibilities he had not entertained. He envied those men and women. [As Dante envies Pietro &amp; Francesco their eternal damnation in each other&apos;s arms.] Now, as the days of his mundane agency were coming to an end, he sighed over all the sins he had not committed. This, he knew, was no state suitable for his next journey. Unlike his original author, Wutz was commencing his journey at the end of his life. Now he regretted that any immoral instruction would be useless. He lit another lamp yet his eyes could not adjust. The darkness he had long fought unthinkingly, was now coming in through his windows, unstoppable. That darkness of the village that had first made him feel splendidly alone; now it came in unbidden, brought with it the light of the stars. As he worked, that long night, his mood lifted; it lifted even as his [perception] began to fail him, as the words on the pages in his mind&apos;s eye became blanched, as the light overcame the marks of the ink, the serifs and descenders, as the light broached no interruption. [Here try to use phrases verbatim from the original, but - ideally - in a transubstantiated sense]. Even the blackness of the ink, that greedy colour that absorbs all light and transforms it into meaning, the bright light of that late night defied even that greediest of colours, overwhelmed it and did not yield itself to allow it to harvest meaning.</div>

      <div>Wutz dies. The bookseller arranges to buy the house and says he will move in himself before letting it out. He immediately makes a catalogue of the library and distributes it. Meanwhile, Wutz&apos;s body is still in the coffin in the house, waiting to be taken down. The bookseller sends out the catalogue - more of a blurb really, boasting of many unique editions, including &quot;a &apos;polyglot infusion&apos; by which the Walloons can acquire a knowledge of low German in less than six weeks&quot; - to all his business acquaintances. Booksellers from all over Europe descend upon Auenthal within a few days and there is an open house at Wutz&apos;s for one day. Curious villagers come up to see what the Schoolmaster had been up to all his life. Former students chuckle without surprise at the rows of handwritten volumes. A very old man appears, climbing out of a carriage with the help of a slightly less old woman. It is the former schoolmaster. When the bookseller declares the sale over - he had sold all the books but made little money and is not happy with the result - all the booksellers and the curious villagers walk down again. Coincidentally it is also Wutz&apos;s funeral. Everyone is disappointed, the booksellers are resentful, the former students are mocking, only the former Schoolmaster seems happy. Wutz&apos;s coffin is flanked by the priest and a couple of altar boys, an official cortege, the minimum dignity allowed by ecclesiastical bureaucracy. Justine seems to be the only woman who wasn&apos;t there and she meets the cortege as she starts to climb the hill. (She is the only one who is touched by the occasion, and does not mock. We end, as we started, paralleling Gatsby.).</div>

      <div>Auenthal, I take to be the place where the story takes place, Wutz&apos;s home town or village, a German-sounding name. (I am also assuming that &apos;in&apos; in German means the same thing it does in English. But I could be wrong, it could be describing his circumstances - Wutz in Love or Wutz in Crisis or Wutz in Pieces - or perhaps, the sectioning of the narrative - in vignettes or in anecdotes - or even a less geographically specific name - Wutz in the Underworld . Our Wutz, then is male, not Latin but almost certainly Catholic. I cannot imagine Lutheran parents demonstrating such obvious Mariolatry in naming their son. The &quot;-lein&quot; ending then is certainly diminutive, affectionate or condescending, &quot;An Ideal Art&quot; Is it foolhardy to suppose that &quot;Eine Art Idyll&quot; means &quot;An Art Idyll&quot; a pastoral narrative grazing on the meadows of letters? It could also mean, for all I know, &quot;An idle art&quot; referring to the tranquil circumstances presupposed by Wutz&apos;s embarking on such an idiosyncratic project.</div>

      <div>I am quite disappointed with my protagonist, this is default German schoolmaster at the end of the eighteenth century. [Pnin&apos;s word... TRACE] I think I may be normalizing the text, taking the least imaginative route, the most plausible. Like Occam, I am drawing the most sensible conclusions unless given reason to believe otherwise. If I go on like this, I will end up with a pessimistic translation, where every word defines the limit, rather than the source of meaning. [use parallel examples from text en face] The translation would be faithful but it is a timid fidelity, lack of imagination rather than being consumed with the object of my fidelity. How can I prevent this excessive caution? In Boolean terms, when two different shapes are superimposed we can choose to AND the areas, or we can choose to OR them. The temptation in translating is to do either of these, leading to an optimistic or pessimistic translation. [What is this called in mathematics?</div>

      <div>I even searched for some facetious independent publisher. A tangential Loeb-like canon undertaken by a meta-Wutz. And if, out of simple curiosity or stubbornness or spendthriftness or vulgarity, one were to set out to look for an English-language translation of the story, one may well be convinced that the schoolmaster Wutz has succeeded in embarrassing potential translators into leaving his story well alone.</div>

      <div>I had not yet made up my mind to read this little story, I was still trying to exercise some self-discipline. At any rate, I had been unable to find an edition in anything but German. Perhaps I could take my cue from Wutz, let him serve as my example. Benjamin&apos;s mention is odd. When he begins with the droll &quot;of all the ways of acquiring books .... Most prestigious is to write them oneself,&quot; he seems to be talking about writers who write their own books. But Wutz seems to be another case altogether. He is inserted into an essay which has already extolled the virtues of not reading the books in your library. Ideally, therefore, Wutz would not read as he wrote... It is not quite the prestige Benjamin seems to be suggesting in the beginning. Wutz&apos;s library strikes me as a particularly barren one, exhausted... one of the attractions of a library is that it warps space, an ingenious way of slicing the universe very thinly and binding it between covers, so that running transversely to the shelves we have sheet upon sheet of unexplored territory, map upon map waiting for a protege, a reminder of the incompleteness of our own life. It would appear very suspect to walk into a writer&apos;s library and find stacked on their shelves only those books they had written themselves. A completely read library is one deprived of potentiality, a trophy case, a display of souvenirs. Obviously, a single walk through a particular route does not exhaust it, there is more than one route down the same road, and even Wutz&apos;s writing/reading does not exhaust, to him, all the possibilities of the book. (Books furnish a room most agreeable by making its walls permeable to the mind, allowing us to walk through walls.)Wutz&apos;s is an odd way of reading. It is reading from a great distance, as though he were tremendously presbyopic. Why did Wutz only write books after he had heard of them? He certainly didn&apos;t expect to pass off his home-bound editions as the real thing. This was a time when the typewriter had not been invented. (Unless, of course, the story is set in the future, a form of science fiction in which Jean Paul foresees a domestic appliance that can manage moveable type.) But why did he feel the need to know of the existence of a book, that it could exist. A starting point is always appreciated when starting on a book - but the most Wutz could have obtained from the catalogues would have been a description of the physical aspects of the book and perhaps a brief sentence about its content. Anyone capable of extrapolating a book from such scant seeds could very easily have written a book out of nothing - or, really, as is always the case, out of a less explicit pretext... Wutz&apos;s volumes therefore consisted of handwritten volumes, possibly locally bound. Would there have been a bookbinder in his village? Did he send them away to be bound? This is unlikely, since we know that he was a man of limited means. Perhaps he knew a man in the book trade. This would also explain how Wutz came to have the opportunity to read bookfair catalogues. Perhaps he selected books that were described as manuscripts, knowing that he could better reproduce handwritten documents than printed ones, plausible.</div>

      <div>A &apos;W&apos; sounds good. It&apos;s a pregnant letter, includes two letters, w is for writing, has graphic presence, the widest of letters, this bulkiest of consonants is itself a nervous consonant, possibly an impostor, really a vowel masquerading as a consonant.. Many (most?) Romance languages can do without it; in the cod-revolutionary demotic of Italian street politics it means Viva, long live. Its superfluous iteration prefaces the locales of our extraterritorial electronic networks.. W is the very essence of ambiguity, it falls loudly but invisibly on the stress of that very word.. W, Perec&apos;s book. Wutz is a likely owner of his initial (in the way that - cf Steiner - Kafka owns the K in a way that Shakepeare does not own the S, nor Dostoevsky the D. The k takes on an algebraic function of representation... an algebraic symbol for self and indeterminate oppression, (kinder, kuche, kirche). It stands in the middle of the alphabet, between the knowns and the unknowns, hectored by both.</div>

      <div>I always find it perverse when some translators use &apos;j&apos; for Quixote: to me, the deluded knight of la Mancha owns the x, perhaps because it&apos;s the privileged letter of algebra, with its epistemological mystery, its promise of unresolved signifiers, which is Quixote&apos;s problem. The algebraic w stands for a book, a potential book... there could be an algebra of books, in which all the volumes in the total library stand in algebraic relation to one another. Mention this w when going over the German text. W as potential book, a hypothetical book, pregnant with possibility - but also, frequently in the English language, silent ... itself a ligature. The &apos;w&apos; resounds in the opening words of this book - &apos;Wie War&apos; [l(ibris) and b(ook) may be more obvious, l has the advantage of evoking the Latin renaissance of algebra (though algebra is Arabic - aleph) but w has many advantages - it has the curvaceous mystery of [mathematical] x and y ... it comes towards the end of the alphabet, with the unknowns, precedes x, w could stand for write ... also from Arabic w- The W possibly partly responsible for Wittgenstein&apos;s mesmeric hold... Whitsun. The Schoolmaster Wutz, Anagram, conclusion... W is an unstable letter - the only one that is plausibly divisible - refer back to our &apos;letter level&apos; discussion, a portmanteau letter.</div>

      <div>The ambition to write is, in itself, pathetic. All good writing must come from a need - but not the need of the writer to write something. Realistically, I suppose, hiding this need, or merging it with its artistic indispensability is the whole craft.</div>

      <div>At the Hilton Olympia cafe: A woman in her fifties, Japanese-looking, sits down and waits for service. After some minutes she goes up to the bar where the waitresses are chatting quite loudly. The woman points to her table and says, I would like to order some things. One of the waitresses tells her, We&apos;re on strike. The woman says, Ah, OK and begins walking back to her table. The waitress tells her she is joking and takes her order. When the woman sits at her table again, she tells me, I thought I was in France, where I&apos;m from.</div>

      <div>CX was very excited by the new Illy cups. We agreed that the cups are not very practical because they are heavy and tend to tip over if you just hold them by the ear between the index finger and the thumb. I liked the saucer, however, because it raises the cup in the centre, higher than the rim, as if on a pedestal. She said she didn&apos;t like the saucers because they are too shallow. &quot;In my country,&quot; [Lithuania] she said, &quot;Illy is the most expensive coffee. And now here I am...&quot; The cafe seemed to have just made some point-of-sale deal with Illy. CX has just finished her studies as a civil engineer.</div>

      <div>&quot;In &apos;The Beast in the Jungle&apos;, a man tells a young woman that he believes he has a special destiny, that he is &apos;being kept for something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible&apos;, the spring of a tiger in the jungle. The man refuses all other experiences, including that of allowing himself to love the young woman, or indeed anyone else, and waits for the big event. The woman dies, but that is not the event. There is no event. There is nothing, although the man does finally realise that nothing was precisely his destiny, that his life was rare and strange, prodigious and terrible, because he had, to a quite unheard of degree, managed to postpone it entirely, turn it into pure expectation.&quot;

      <div>TMcI&apos;s trauma 1: When he was a child he saw two drakes pecking at a duck. He felt sorry for the duck and wanted to rescue her. So he rushed towards the threesome to disperse them. The duck flew straight into the path of an oncoming truck; the two drakes flew away safely. Upon the impact of the duck&apos;s body with the radiator grill of the truck, an egg popped out of her body and fell to the ground.</div>

      <div>TMcI&apos;s trauma 2: When he was a child, he was in the school choir. There was a big concert at the South Australia Opera House coming up, and he was concerned that he was singing out of tune. In the choir, he stood next to a Greek kid gifted with a great timbre who was very enthusiastic about singing. Thom was in awe of this kid&apos;s voice and both his talent and enthusiasm made him feel guilty for letting the choir down. So he told the choirmistress about his concerns and she said she&apos;d check whether T was singinging out of tune. She sat at the piano and got the Greek kid and T to sing. She then declared that T was singining in tune and the Greek kid wasn&apos;t. He got kicked out of the choir and took it very badly. T probably took it worse.</div>

His friend bet him that he couldn&apos;t hit the seagull with a stone. T knew he couldn&apos;t and so accepted the bet. He threw a stone and killed the seagull.</div>

      <div>To research around the story too much would be a bit like enquiring after somebody behind their back, dishonest, indecent. And also to prejudice oneself, so that the only thing remaining in the translation is not the voice of the author, but the acoustic quality [direct reference to a concert hall - nice image but is it the right one? It seems to be more about the reception.] of his age.</div>

      <div>Hastings, 08.09.03: Everyone says you should write things down. Gets them out of the system. &quot;Externalises&quot; them, in the jargon. ST has been telling me this. She read it in some book called &apos;How to Liberate the Artist Within You&apos; or something like that. Yet for me it somehow feels that when I write it down it becomes real. It will look at me in the face and haunt me. That once it&apos;s on paper, it exists and can&apos;t be undone. Another thing everyone says is, &quot;What would you do if you knew you had six months left to live?&quot; Or six days. Or six hours. Thing is, How do you keep your mind off those six hours?</div>

      <div>On Independence Day (14 August) there was a form of enforced but relaxed patriotism going on.

Shabbaz said, Ah, we should have a flag Then someone honked the horn, Karim wound down the window and someone in a passing car gave him a plastic flag. Shabbaz had the holder for it and put it on the window. But in the next straight stretch, where Shabbaz accelerated, the wind took it.</div>

      <div>Richard Dawkins... [Start with that joke in 2000 Years, &quot;My God, it&apos;s like living with a Muslim.&quot;, improved by the fact that it is ever so slightly in bad taste. Then: There comes a point in The God Delusion when the shrillness of the arguments, the ... /pile them up/ that the strictures of comic timing simply require your mind to think, &quot;Christ! It&apos;s like living with a Born-Again Christian.&quot;] A born-again Atheist. Dawkins has allowed himself to become fundamentalist.... A believer who is not haunted by doubt is no more boring than an atheist/agnostic/humanist who is not haunted by Faith.... This is ironic - because science is, by definition, haunted by doubt. All its conclucions are provisional. It is understandable that Dawkins would be driven to this by the wrongheadedness of Intelligent Design and its dishonest use of turning the scientific method against itself. .... The fact that he is probably right is of little consolation.</div>

      <div>Up to the mid-90s it was PC to refer to Asian people as black. Asian Dub Foundation referred to themselves as such. Later, this morphed into Black &amp; Asian. This categorisation is now almost unthinkably bumpkinish. One distasteful interpretation of this would be that Asians earned the right to dissociate themselves from Blacks as dividend of their increasing (economic and) cultural power. A Spivakian interpretation could conflict or reinforce this interpretation.</div>

      <div>Indeed, primitivism - or, at any rate - atavism is part of the point here. Rehyphenation comes from Heidegger&apos;s emphasis, I think, of invoking the etymology of a word. The belief that if the word is unpacked, its hidden meaning would emerge resplendent - an [essentialist] superstition; very odd when used by &apos;postmodernists&apos;.</div>

      <div>So I found a cheap German edition and sent off for it, and I forgot about Wutz. [NP] Whenever I come across a new name in my reading, an author I had not heard of, or a book or place, I immediately start seeing references to that name everywhere. Often within a few days, hours even, I will come across another mention, and then another, and so on. Enough to chide myself for my careless reading - how could I have missed such a commonly referenced name? Or had the name just invented itself and I am merely following its youthful reproductive precocity? But I never again came across a single reference to the Schoolmaster Wutz, not even a second-hand quote via Benjamin. Jean Paul was slightly easier to track down; and I started by following up on that Carlyle translation of another work by Jean Paul, Quintus Fixlein. (Why not Wutz? It&apos;s a much shorter work; he could have practiced on it.) Thomas Carlyle, it turns out, was quite taken by Jean Paul. So I searched Sartor Resartus for any mention of Jean Paul and found the following. While describing the tailor-philosopher Teufelsdrockh: &quot;Certainly a most involved, self-secluded, altogether enigmatic nature, this of Teufelsdrockh! Here, however, we gladly recall to mind that once we saw him laugh; once only, perhaps it was the first and last time in his life; but then such a peal of laughter, enough to have awakened the Seven Sleepers! It was of Jean Paul&apos;s doing: some single billow in that vast World-Mahlstrom of Humor, with its heaven-kissing coruscations, which is now, alas, all congealed in the frost of death! The large-bodied Poet and the small, both large enough in soul, sat talking miscellaneously together, the present Editor being privileged to listen; and now Paul, in his serious way, was giving one of those inimitable &quot;Extra-Harangues;&quot; and, as it chanced, On the Proposal for a Cast-metal King.&quot; So, more recollection, more laughter. Carlyle then enters into a swoft disquisition on what is to be inferred from the capacity to laugh. &quot;How much lies in Laughter: the cipher-key, wherewith we decipher the whole man! Some men wear an everlasting barren simper; in the smile of others lies a cold glitter as of ice: the fewest are able to laugh, what can be called laughing, but only sniff and titter and snigger from the throat outwards; or at best, produce some whiffling husky cachinnation, as if they were laughing through wool: of none such comes good. The man who cannot laugh is not only fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; but his whole life is already a treason and a stratagem.&quot; Carlyle obviously thought very highly of Jean Paul, the &quot;large-bodied&quot; poet (like Johnson). To find another reference to Jean Paul in another of Carlyle&apos;s work, The Latter-Day Pamphlets, one doesn&apos;t have to go far. The epigraph comes straight from the large-bodied poet&apos;s pen: &quot;But as yet struggles the twelfth hour of the Night. Birds of darkness are on the wing; spectres uproar; the dead walk; the living dream. Thou, Eternal Providence, wilt make the Day dawn!&quot; (Happily, electronic search methods obviate the need to wade through Carlyle&apos;s writing.) There is a single reference to Jean Paul in The French Revolution, &quot;As Jean Paul says, of his own Life, &apos;to a great height shall the business of Hungering go&apos;&quot; Carlyle is here discussing scarcity of work in post-revolutionary France. Carlyle is Jean Paul&apos;s ambassador to the English language.</div>

      <div>Then I realised that I had lived with a strong reference to Jean Paul since adolescence. And I have a feeling that Jean Paul is the kind of author that people picked up in their adolescence, or rather used to pick up in their adolescence in the 19th Century. It has been said that there are &apos;young&apos; authors and &apos;old&apos; authors, authors that have their optimal voice when they are young and those that grow into their voice. This has nothing to do with either their talent or the gravity of their subject matter. Similarly, I believe there are authors who appeal especially to the adolescent mind. These are almost invariably brilliant writers. The reference I mentioned is Mahler&apos;s first symphony, nicknamed &apos;Titan&apos; after his favourite of Jean Paul&apos;s novels. Jean Paul was the greatest influence on the young Gustav Mahler. This was at the time when Mahler was trying his hand at poetry. Although these poems are largely a source of embarrassment for all his apologists, some of them were partly recycled to serve as lyric or programme for Mahler&apos;s later work. Mahler was always quite indecisive about whether to let his music follow an abstract schema or to impose a programme as was fashionable at the time. If there were a programme at all in Mahler&apos;s mind as he created his first symphony, it must have been greatly affected by a stormy and largely unhappy romance he pursued with a young soprano, Johanna Richter. The superstitious Mahler would certainly have been impressed by the coincidence in his lover&apos;s family name. The names which the individual movements were temperamentally given were also derived from Jean Paul&apos;s work. The last time they saw each other, they waited in tearful silence together for the New Year 1885 to be rung in.</div>

      <div>The other mentions I came across were slight but from more cheerful sources. A biographical note introducing a collection of Italo Svevo&apos;s short stories alerted me to the fact that Svevo had read Jean Paul. (The mention is quite confusing.) Now a man may drink from any fountain and urinate selectively but I find it impossible to imagine Svevo reading an indigestible writer. Carlyle&apos;s endorsement may work against the German in some minds but Svevo, this master of irony, master chronicler of human fallibility... Jean Paul may have been part of Svevo&apos;s self-constructed identity as Italo-German (Italo Swabian), so is Jean Paul very German? Is Jean Paul therefore emblematic of Germany, as emblematic as, say, Wagner? And is Wutz a significant moment in the documentation of the German character? Is Jean Paul the kind of writer one reads in order to discover the German-ness within oneself, on a par with Goethe, Rilke and the other Richter?</div>

      <div>A calendar applied to dates when it wasn&apos;t actually in use is called proleptic. Thus, if we assume there was never a cutover and Gregorian rules always rule, we have a proleptic Gregorian calendar. This is what is used by MySQL, as is required by standard SQL. For this reason, dates prior to the cutover stored as MySQL DATE or DATETIME values must be adjusted to compensate for the difference. It is important to realize that the cutover did not occur at the same time in all countries, and that the later it happened, the more days were lost. For example, in Great Britain, it took place in 1752, when Wednesday September 2 was followed by Thursday September 14. Russia remained on the Julian calendar until 1918, losing 13 days in the process, and what is popularly referred to as its &apos;&apos;&quot;October Revolution&apos;&apos;&quot; occurred in November according to the Gregorian calendar.</div>

      <div>&quot;There would be an announcement: &apos;&apos;The train will arrive at 18.15 and depart at 18.20,&apos;&apos; and it never did arrive at 18.15. Then came the next announcement: &apos;&apos;The train will arrive at 20.10.&apos;&apos; And so on. You went on sitting there in the waiting-room, thinking, it&apos;&apos;s bound to come at 20.15. That was the situation: basically, a state of Messianic anticipation. There are constant announcements of the Messiah&apos;&apos;s impending arrival, and you know perfectly well that he won&apos;&apos;t be coming. And yet somehow, it&apos;&apos;s good to hear him announced all over again.&quot; - Heiner Mueller</div>

      <div>RIPE: In front of St John&apos;s Cathedral (Valletta): An American woman behind me talks about an ex-boyfreind. He&apos;d studied &quot;computers&quot;. She&apos;d studies Philosophy, Art History and French. He had told her it was a waste of time., &quot;insulted&quot; her. She later heard from a friend that this man&apos;s eventual marriage had problems. She kept saying, &quot;he was from another parish&quot; and said &quot;that&apos;s why I came to Malta to look for a man&quot;. This ex took his wife on honeymoon to Disneyland. Her dinner companion, a taciturn Maltese man, laughed out loud. His first reaction. The woman is encouraged, but she talks about him as though he&apos;s not eligible, as though he&apos;s a cousin. &quot;See - that&apos;s European.&quot; She has a slow, descriptive voice. This ex took all his holidays in Disneyland. She then used a particular rhetorical device [trace] drawing up two parallel, contrasting lists, interweaving them contrapuntally. &quot;Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy. When you can go to France, England, Egypt. My brother went on honeymoon to the Amalfi Coast. Huey, Duey, Luey. And this is the man you&apos;re giving your virginity to? Can you imagine starting sexual relations in that atmosphere? Rollercoasters and kabuki...&quot; Then she asks the man if he&apos;d seen Lord of the Rings. He has and wasn&apos;t very impressed. She&apos;s shocked. She makes a spirited defence of the film as an allegory about Faith. That the old men are the priests (she seems to think this is particularly ingenious).</div>

      <div>On another table a (German?) man sits with a Maltese woman. He speaks English haltingly and with the self-consciousness of someone who&apos;s learning it formally, occasionally he refers to his &quot;lessons&quot;. She is tanned and blonde. The irony is he talks about literature, mentions Pushkin (she&apos;s definitely Maltese though she&apos;s dressed a bit in Russian style). She seems to have little interest in this but still has the upper hand in the conversation. Flies bother her, he says &quot;I will be your slave. I will wave. With palm.&quot;</div>

      <div>Hitchens constantly accuses religion of plagiarism. This is childish. First of all, plagiarism is verbatim copying. All culture uses influence and paraphrase and appropriation. (Otherwise the Orwell Estate might have a thing or two to say to Hitchens). This is culture. And it&apos;s very significant that Hitchens would do away with this influence. This is the continuity that religion gives. Does not acknowledge the debt to religion.</div>

      <div>These books (Hitchens and Dawkins) indicate a problem but give a heavy-handed solution. The problem is how a thinking secular person is to deal with religious fanaticism. Nowhere is this clearer than in Creationism. Creationism uses the scientific method against itself.</div>

      <div>Hitchens (and Dawkins) risk becoming the Michael Moore of secularism. A celebrity who stands for an idea, who displaces it. Much lamenting goes on about our celebrity culture; but the focus is usually on talentlessness. Big Brother celebrity is actually a purer, harmless form of celebrity. Celebrity culture among intellectuals, with an audience of people who should know better. How many people at the SOAS-style gatherings are even familiar with the central thesis of Orientalism? Embodies an idea by displacing it. </div>

      <div>The Scientific Method is a constant investigation. Creationist arguments can be patiently defetaed - but when they show dioramas of men walking with dinosaurs - but they are understandably suspected of being in bad faith. Science works by defeating false hypotheses. In the ongoing investigation that is science, creationists are wasting police time. Science humbly asserts things. It is not fundamentalist. It does not deal with absolute truths but makeshift truths. This is what defines science. And the awkward thing is listening to scientists dishing out absolute truths in defence of a world view founded on scepticism. Polarising, it&apos;s not exactly bracing to think that our world view is founded on wishy-washiness. We need an honest body of &apos;values&apos; but we won&apos;t get there by denying our roots, as it were, our debt to religion.</div>

And this debate is odd because they are supplying a narrative and post-modernism can accomodate that. Odd because Dawkins and Hitchens end up sounding more old-fashioned than the Creationists.

      <div>&quot;Perhaps the most famous of all the letters. In it Jerome lays down at great length the motives which ought to actuate those who devote themselves to a life of virginity, and the rules by which they ought to regulate their daily conduct. The letter contains a vivid picture of Roman society as it then was--the luxury, profligacy, and hypocrisy prevalent among both men and women, besides some graphic autobiographical details (? 7, 30), and concludes with a full account ofthe three kinds of monasticism then practised in Egypt (34-36). Thirty years later Jerome wrote a similar letter to Demetrias (Letter 30), with which this ought to be compared. Written at Rome A.D. 384&quot;</div>

      <div>Sleeping with BH. A dream: I notice that instead of a skeleton she has chicken-wire. She tells me that her family has belonged to this cult for years, they operate on the children intermittently and replace bone with chicken-wire. I can see it underneath her skin. I find it odd that she has no scars from the operation. I calculate how long ago the latest operation would have been. This dream reminded me of a previous dream which seemed to confirm it. At the same time I have the image in my head of a sort of bas-relief frame of a human body made of chicken-wire over a cardboard frame.</div>

      <div>That day I read no more. Like an avenger in the Arabian Nights, I was transfixed by the promise of a story. I could not do anything else until I knew the rest of it. Who was this Wutz? How come I had not heard of him before? What kind of pleasure would I be feeling now if I had? Am I always the last one to know these things? Several times I tried to read Benjamin&apos;s &apos;talk&apos; to the end, but as soon as I came to Wutz, my attention would start foundering; I would start clutching for a recognisable face among the minor classics of bookish whimsy: Max Beerbohm&apos;s mediocre poet Enoch Soames surrendering his immortal soul to gloat over posterity&apos;s esteem - but this Wutz sounded far less vain; Flaubert&apos;s Bouvard and Pecuchet, provincial omniscientists - but this Wutz sounded less ambitious. Arbuthnot&apos;s Scriblerus was far too vulgar a figure in my mind, that curlicued Latinate name too much of a mouthful compared to the mere sneeze of the schoolmaster&apos;s name. I had already formed an image of this Wutz as a humble and unsophisticated schoolmaster, perhaps because of the dismissive way Benjamin talks about him. Where were my images coming from? Mostly other stories helpfully available in English-language editions. Goldsmith&apos;s village savant, for instance, remembered from the Dragon Book of Verse. I remember how its phrase-by-phrase explication gave my teachers occasion to mythologise themselves, to demonstrate, at once, the great progress in pedagogy and the eternally scatterbrained and facetious nature of students everywhere. Stern and earnest, this Wutz, extemporising far above his rustic companions&apos; comprehension, his day&apos;s labour but Zarathustra&apos;s descent from the mountain, distributing Olympian booty among impish children of the land and, pausing as he traffics about the village, to bewildered farmers and grocers and a worried parson; his pedagogy deeply-felt, if rather futile. He is the tabulator of their universe, its measurer and annotator. Folk approach him with simple questions and are repaid in diatribes, jeremiads, tirades, rhapsodies, philippics. These are the hours of his condescension.</div>

      <div>When I was flying from malta, some british scum and her mother (probably ex-pat) were having an argument with the ryanair check-in girl. i think she didn&apos;t let them check in too much luggage or something. they spoke to the manager and the manager politely said that, in this case, &quot;the customer is not always right&quot;. the brit thought this was blasphemy - as though the doctrine of justification by faith alone had been questioned - and said, &quot;oh, that is so maltese. that&apos;s why you&apos;re all backwards.&quot; if i weren&apos;t going to be on the same plane, i&apos;d have put a bomb on it. you don&apos;t fly into a country on fucking ryanair and then think you&apos;re Stamford Raffles. that&apos;s why they sell you scratchcards on the way, to make it clear exactly where you stand in the global pecking order. This is an Irish service sold to the English, after all. And you must never underestimate Irish wit. &quot;Now, children, you&apos;re going to a place called abroad [where a people called the Savages live] but let&apos;s not get any fancy ideas.&quot; (Use post-colonial interpretation of Ulysses.)</div>

      <div>The Castle Prague: on Sunday, there was Paul McCartney on television (BBC World in hotel.) he was in Moscow. The was a fan from Ukraine and he said he wanted to invite Paul there because he mentions Ukraine. Paul McCartney also mentioned the line (&quot;Ukraine girls screaming from behind, they leave the west behind.&quot;) and said it&apos;s a parody of California girls (of course). That evening went to club, met Hannah or Helena or whatever her name was. She was with her brother. Monday went to museum of communism in the morning. then coffee then Mucha museum. On the way to old town square, an attractive woman smiled at me very intently. Once in the square, a red-haired woman walked past me smiling. then we were walking a couple of meters from each other. Then I stopped to look at the car and she walked past, smiling. Then on Charles Bridge we passed each other several times then I went down to Maltese square and she smiled at me as I went down, following my eyes. When I came back up she wasn&apos;t there so I decided to go to the castle, assuming that&apos;s where she will be. Went up there, couldn&apos;t see her. Was smoking a cigarette looking at city. A girl arrives and stands a couple of metres away. She is wearing white trainers, jeans, red knickers (which you could see over the hem) a navy blue bra (you could only see the straps) and a sort of monochrome camouflage top showing a lot of midriff and cleavage. Her breasts were big and squeezed together by the bra. I could see her pulling down her top to cover her slight belly. She took out a wad of green post-its and wrote a note. She sighed, and I figured she wouldn&apos;t want to be disturbed. I put 10k in the telescope and looked and looked, then when it clicked shut, the girl looked over; we smiled at each other slightly. A few minutes later i asked her where Charles bridge is, pretending I couldn&apos;t make it out. Turned out she didn&apos;t speak English, or Italian, or German or French. But she was very happy to show me. She took a long time about showing me on the map, holding it just under her breasts so that my eyes could not look at the map without looking at her breasts and her deep cleavage. She had huge breasts, though I suspected the bra was doing a lot of the work, beautiful, white skin. I asked her if she wanted to come into the castle with me and she said yes. She introduced herself and said her name is Svetlana and she&apos;s from the Ukraine. We walked around the castle, laughed at gargoyles, looked at the changing of the guard. We spoke to each other, I spoke English and she spoke Ukrainian. We used the phrases section of the rough guide to exchange information. She said she&apos;d been in Prague for ten months (student? she looks 18-25) and I told her I leave tomorrow. She showed me where she lives, on the map. We threw coins in the fountain and I wished to fuck her. we wet our hands in the water. Then we started walking down. Half way down she crossed the road and sat me down for a coffee. She looked at my Mucha brochure and frowned quite superiorly, which I liked. We had a dark coffee with cream. (She insisted on paying for it.) I went to the bathroom. we were smiling at each other. I caught her looking down to see if I had an erection. I&apos;d had one in the bathroom. A man passed with a dog leash in his hand but no dog. We laughed. She had a way of raising a single eye-brow, like Irene. I made a big(ish) deal of not being able to do this. Then, when we were smiling at each other, she said &quot;domu ich&quot; which more or less I understood to be &quot;my house&quot;. I said yes (by now I&apos;d learnt &quot;ne&quot; and &quot;ano&quot;) we held hands and started walking down, urgently but not hurriedly. We walked back down Charles Bridge, making silly jokes about not being able to see with shades, etc. We went to see the astronomical clock. It was about half an hour before it was due to strike again so we decided not to wait for it. We kissed under the clock, very gently. She kissed me again and shook her head and said &apos;ne&apos;. I was slightly annoyed. We walked towards Wenceslas Square and she got into a phone box and called somebody, getting the number from her little notebook. She was doing her best to sound very cheerful though she seemed quite nervous, almost embarrassed. I heard her say &apos;chika chika chika&apos; to the other person. She tried somebody else but couldn&apos;t get through. Although it was quite clear that she was calling her flat mate, I started to think something dodgy could be going on. Was I foolish to go back home with someone I couldn&apos;t even communicate with? We went to sit on one of the benches on the traffic island. We kissed, very sweetly and she was enjoying it. She sat on my knee and we kissed some more. Then she took my hand and we walked up to the top of Wenceslas Square and we went to the museum&apos;s garden. She took off her top and started touching my cock, making it hard. She put my hands on her huge tits. I held them in my hands. I pushed down her jeans and her red pants and fucked her from behind. I went right inside her, making her gasp. I kept rubbing her clit while I fucked her. Then I turned her round to me and frigged her until she came in my hand. She kept wanking me with her thumb and forefinger ringed round my cock until I came. Soon after I came we noticed two policemen coming round. By the time they came up to us we were both dressed. She spoke to them, they let us go and we walked away. She was very shaken by this. (Illegally in the country?) She walked me to the tube, gave me coins for the tube and ran off.</div>

      <div>YD has the beautiful quality of being completely non-judgmental about, say, her veganism. She would happily sit across the table from me while I ate a steak tartare without the scoffing and huffing of many of her type. And yet, beautiful as these qualities are in a person, desirable as they are in a friend, it comes across as aloof, self-centred. (The same can, of course, be said of my own hyper-tolerance.)</div>

      <div>Serial killers are so boring. Reading Musil&apos;s 1700-page novel, the only passages I found unbearable were the Moosbrugger chapters, trying to extract profundity from the banality of it. This is not quite the banality of evil, in some ways it&apos;s the exact opposite. It&apos;s a project embarked upon by somebody with a particularly suburban view of the nature of evil.</div>

      <div>&quot;I have never subjected myself to an idea with staying power.  One never turned up.  One should love an idea like a woman;  be overjoyed to get back to it.  And one always has it inside oneself! And always looks for it in everything outside!  I never formed such ideas.  My relationship to the so-called great ideas, and perhaps even to those that really are great, has always been man-to-man:  I never felt I was born to submit to them;  they always provoked me to overthrow them and put others in their place.&quot; - This certainly doesn&apos;t apply to me.</div>

      <div>The Settlement Act restricted internal migration for poor people: &quot;There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662 - this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish - mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. A pauper applicant had to prove a &apos;settlement&apos;.If they could not, they were removed to the next parish that was nearest to the place of their birth, or where they might prove some connection. Some paupers were moved hundreds of miles. Although each parish that they passed through was not responsible for them, they were supposed to supply food and drink and shelter for at least one night. The Act was criticised in later years for its effect in distorting the labour market, through the power given to parishes to let them remove &apos;undeserving&apos; poor.&quot; - Wikipedia</div>

      <div>&quot;...suppose that a test for a particular disease is 99 per cent reliable (meaning that only 1 per cent of healthy people test positive) and that the disease affects 1 in 10,000 people in the relevant age group. If Jane, randomly selected, tests positive, roughly how probable is it that she actually has the disease? Most people - including a disturbingly high proportion of doctors - conclude that she is likely to have the disease; in fact, her chance of having it is less than 1 per cent. (Out of every 10,000 people, it would be expected that 1 would have the disease and that about 100 would falsely test positive; the chance that a positive test result indicates the presence of the disease is therefore no more than 1 out of 101.)&quot;</div>

      <div>&quot;Leonard Bernstein, who was instrumental in championing Mahler&apos;s music after his lifetime, portrayed the Symphony as the prophetic musical statement of the 20th century crisis in classical music. Not only did Mahler know he would not live long after the work was completed in 1908, but (according to Bernstein) he also &quot;prophesized&quot; through the music that the death of major/minor tonality was soon at hand. A further extension of that idea also implied the death of Faustian culture and perhaps the entire human race (the rumblings of World War I were already apparent) were soon at hand.&quot; - Wikipedia</div>

      <div>&quot;The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.&quot; John Maynard Keynes - The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, ch. 24, 1936</div>

      <div>TS says niggers without seeming to realise its associations. She seems to know it only from Tarantino movies. On Tuesday (while she still thought I was gone) she met three &apos;rastas&apos; and smoked a joint with them. She told me, and apparently her class, that she had had the opportunity to express her anti-racism. She was proud and excited about this. I don&apos;t think she&apos;d ever spoken to another black person before.</div>

      <div>TS: I was having a coffee at De Giorgio&apos;s when a young woman came to look at the menu. She was wearing a short grey dress with large yellow letters on it, a bit retro, very Shoreditch. We smiled at each other and she looked at the menu and came in. We smiled at each other another couple of times. I was reading about London magazines, Dazed, etc in Spook Country (William Gibson). She went to the bathroom and asked the waiter to look after her things. As she rose, I could almost see up her skirt. I tried to make myself look as fascinating as possible, using my laptop, taking notes, looking at my printouts. I wondered if I should go and talk to her but then she got up to leave so I thought whatever. I looked down at my laptop again and there she was by my table. She said something like, I&apos;m a bit bored can I sit down and talk to you? Turned out she&apos;s Ukrainian, fashion journalist, studying English here, her first day. We talked for a bit, then started walking towards Ghar id-Dud. She obviously mentioned all the Russians in Malta, how perfectly turned-out they are, the social reasons for this (country girls trying to attract oligarch&apos;s attention - &quot;Cinderella&quot;, she said it&apos;s very hip-hop and sometimes girls were stopped while driving and married an oligrach a week later.) and how she&apos;s not like that. She really isn&apos;t, sadly. We walked along the front, went and sat down by the railings before the turning into St Julians. Then we bought an ice-cream and sat by the sea. I&apos;d been swimming so I had my towel with me. We sat there and ate the ice-cream and talked, exchanging history of Malta &amp;amp; Ukraine. She was particularly interested in the Russian connection of the post-Napoleonic knights when the tsar wanted to create a theocracy and Malta seemed like a good prospective member. We went to Surfside for a drink. After a lot of running around I got us drinks G&amp;amp;T for me, white wine for her, and a sprite. She&apos;d said she gets drunk on two glasses and refused a second one. She admired the curtains (&apos;arabical&apos;). (Sometimes, though her English falters, she runs into a perfect technical description of a dress.) There was a red cemetery candle at the table. We could hear the waves. We joked about skinny-dipping. She said she felt happy. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the curtains... Or you...&quot; The bar closed and we were left in the dark with just the candle and two groups of Spanish students singing and calling out to each other. We started kissing and touching. I could feel the stubs of her inexpertly shaved facial hair. I enjoyed feeling these hairs on the bottom of my upper lip as I withdrew it. I put first one then two fingers up her pussy. We left, walked her back to her hotel (Astra, near Preluna, 2 stars.) She told me her surname, Solovey, means that bird that sings in the night. I couldn&apos;t remember which one. (Two days later she said she meant nightingale.) When we got to her hotel she became flustered again. She gave me her email (all evening we&apos;d been saying, I&apos;ll send you this and that.) She said, Why do you have to go.</div>

      <div>When I had decided to stay in Malta, I emailed TS and went try to find her after her class. I searched online for her school and found the address and the session times. First I waited for her at Tony&apos;s Bar then I went outside her school; I met her and she seemed anxious, she only had a little time because she was going to the internet cafe to speak to her family. I think she might have thought I&apos;d just said I was going away just to precipitate things with her or something. Bumped into her again in the afternoon, she still seemed anxious. But when we met in the evening, she relaxed immediately. We went swimming, she snuggled up to me, then went for an ice-cream and talked about movies. We only snogged at the end, she does this enthusiastically, generous with her tongue, but then looks away with girlish self-consciousness.</div>

      <div>On Thursday I went with TS to Mdina. It took some time to find the direct bus from Sliema. Finally got there, she was very impressed with Mdina. I bluetoothed Pit-Bull Terrier to her, she was very happy about it and she kissed me on the cheek. We went round Mdina. Then we went to Crystal Palace. They&apos;d run out of pastizzi but we got qassatat. She loved them. We went back inside Mdina, went to a rooftop bar. We sat at the far table. (Next to us was a rowdy table of people discussing Festa economics. One of them was a member of a Valletta club. He had a huge growth at the back of his neck, reddened by the sun. Otherwise, he appeared to be in ruddy health. They were talking about this man who does very vulgar festa decorations in another village. He bought a statue of Sta Lucia in Italy and the next day was drilling her neck to insert a dagger.) TS and I kissed and she spread her legs slightly in my direction and I stroked her pussy, just a metre from the other table, she flapped her head this way and that. Later we went to the belvedere and again I started rubbing her pussy while standing behind her. She opened the buttons of her skirt. Maltese youths started making kissing sounds. She said let&apos;s go somewhere more comfortable. We walked around Rabat, looking for a hotel. Then we went back to the bench and sat on it. She slept a bit. Then we called for a taxi. While waiting for it, again, I rubbed her pussy at Saqqajja, this time pulling her knickers back and doing it vigorously. She arched her neck back and opened her mouth as if to scream. In the taxi she lay across my body. </div>

      <div>TS has very thin lips. She must be conscious of this because she never just pecks on the lips, even when it would be more appropriate, she always slips the tongue, as if to proffer a mucous membrane in compensation. She said her favourite Russian actress, who has the style of Marlene Dietrich, has thin lips, &quot;like mine&quot;.</div>

      <div>TS has an encyclopaedic knowledge of film, she studied scriptwriting for television for a year. She has not only seen Stalker, but actually read the novel it&apos;s based on. Every time I mention a film she hasn&apos;t seen, she takes down the title. She is very anxious not to have heard of someone. She knew Robbe-Grillet, and was offended that I asked if she did, though not Resnais&apos; films. (Later, in Gozo, she said she&apos;d read The City of God! - it was almost awkward because were were saying goodbye a few hours later) Yet she kicked herself for not having heard of William Gibson.</div>

      <div>Saturday I went to Valletta with TS. We went to the barrakkas then went to Fort st Elmo where a man showed us around a bit. We briefly flirted with the idea of not going to Gozo and staying on to see the short-film festival. [....] I waited for her while she changed, went down to the front and bought ribbed condoms. The least fancy ones they had. We got a bus to Cirkewwa (I stopped the driver and he waited for us. Tanya got on with a granita and he complained but let us on. The bus was empty.) We got to Cirkewwa, got the ship after about ten minutes, took the ferry, got a taxi to Marsalforn went to a hotel and got a room. Everything went smoothly. When we were in the room, on the balcony that faced the beach, first thing she wanted to do was go inside and fuck. She lay down on the bed, took off her top. (She&apos;d been wearing a print top, a children&apos;s hat and lense-less blue glasses.) Then she took off her skirt, then her knickers. She looked much taller horizontal and naked. I kissed her breasts, and her beautiful, shaved, strangely scent-free, wet pussy. I started to lick it and put my fingers inside her. I was wondering whether she&apos;d have a problem with me using a condom but when I put one on, she said &apos;let me help you&apos; and tried to roll it down with her mouth. But the condom was caught on the foreskin under my glans. My cock was really hard and we fucked slowly. She liked it slow and shallow, very beautiful. Then we went out for an ice-cream. We talked about the Russian and Ukrainian languages. She wanted to go back to the room. We went back and fucked more. Then we fell asleep. In the morning I heard her sleep-talking in Russian. She also said, &apos;there are plastic chairs on the balcon&apos;. (There were, white. Also a bucket overflowing with airconditioning condensation.) In the morning we fucked some more. She positioned herself awkwardly when doggy style but could be because she had a rash on her arse. She seemed more comfortable in the spooning position. She went on top of me too, and her light body was ideal. We snogged as we fucked. Then I took off the condom and she sucked me off, shallow and tender, cupping and caressing  my balls, until I came in her mouth. We slept a bit, checked out and went for breakfast (scrambled eggs on toast for me, jam on toast for her). Then we went swimming. Then we went for lunch (pasta). We talked a lot, about philosophy, theology (she&apos;d read City of God). Then we swam again. She was hanging on to me at the buoy. Got the bus to Rabat in the nick of time. We walked around the Citadel then had a coffee. She wanted to see the festa so we went to Kercem. She told me about the Pioneers. She compared the Festa with Soviet demonstrations of the end of WWII and 1st May. Then we walked back to Rabat and on to Mtarfa. During the crossing we looked at the three-quarters moon and hugged. She asked if I see a man&apos;s face or a girl holding two jugs of water on a stick across her shoulders. She told me a fairy-tale about a girl whose step-mother made her fetch heavy pails of water in this way; then she made a wish and was elevated to the moon. TS also mentioned B. Akunin. We got to Cirkewwa and walked to Ghadira. She was very tired by now. She asked me for a cigarette but I&apos;d run out. We got a minibus to Mellieha; then a taxi to Sliema. (She said I&apos;m very lucky.) I chatted with the driver about the transport strike the following day. The radio was playing, Yes Sir I can Boogie. We sang along. She asked me what the second line is. We got down at Preluna, I gave the driver 20 Euros and he gave me five back. We walked to her place. We started talking about black market. I told her Omar was employed illegally by Gucci etc in Italy. She wasn&apos;t surprised, she said that could happen in Ukraine. I got the feeling she was slightly irritated that I was talking about this, as though to avoid the farewells. We walked the last 100m silently. She asked, again, do you have to go? I said this time I had to. (I&apos;d never told her I&apos;d stayed because of her.) We snogged one last time, hugged, she opened the door, blew me a kiss and went in. I walked to Paceville, sort of thinking of doing online check-in. Then walked back to Msida where I saw four women with fanny-packs power walking and saying the Rosary. Possibly walking to work due to transport strike. I bought a bottle of Fanta, drank it then pissed in it. It was about 5 in the morning. Finally got home, chatted with my mum and went to bed.</div>

      <div>Next day I had an AAT meeting at 9 in the morning. At reception I was reading an article from Company magazine about Ceri. She appeared, we chatted; later I texted her, usual flirting which stopped - as usual - when I explicitly asked her over. I emailed LT and we had an email conversation. I was a bit lovesick for TS. I emailed her the photos and some from Last Year In Marienbad. Kept looking at a slideshow of her pictures. I keep checking for a reply. In the evening went to BH and had the usual, glorious, sex.</div>

      <div>Two Polish workers at Starbucks, coffee-break smoking, one born in 1986 (she said, incredulously discussing ration cards). One of them is describing Dekalog to the other. She tells her it&apos;s based on the Ten Commandments. They try to remember them. The only one that seems to spring to mind is Do Not Kill.</div>

      <div>&quot;You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion... Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat&apos;s meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.&quot; - Point Counter Point. In My childhood, the opposite argument was made. Atheists were compared to animals on the grounds that animals don&apos;t believe in God. Then again, animals do not have oral sex.</div>

So, Snegurotchka died when she tried to jump over the fire. She just blown away. So, be careful. Don`t fall in love with her! </div>
