    <p>That day I read no more. Like some avenger in the Arabian Nights, I was transfixed by the promise of a good story. When I had picked up this collection of Benjaminâ€™s essays, I was trying to trace a reference for something I was writing at the time, but now I could not do anything else until I knew the rest. Who was this schoolmaster Wutz? What did he look like? Why did he start writing all the books he heard about? Was he married? What did his wife think about this? Was he materially poor, or simply pitiable for his mania? Was he physically little? If he was materially poor, how come he had so much spare time on his hands?</p>
