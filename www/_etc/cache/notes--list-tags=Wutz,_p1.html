        <p class="first">He believed that. Nihilation is not really some fortuitous incident. Rather, as the repelling gesture toward the retreating whole of beings, Seattle, it discloses these beings in their full but heretofore concealed strangeness as what is radically other — with respect to the nothing. In the clear night of the nothing of anxiety the original openness of beings as such arises: that they are beings — and not nothing. But this “and not nothing” we add in our talk is not some kind of appended clarification. Rather it makes possible in advance the revelation of beings in general. The essence of the originally nihilating nothing lies in this, that it brings Dasein for the first time before beings as such. Implying.</p>

        <p class="first">"In geometry, two sets are called congruent if one can be transformed into the other by an isometry, i.e., a combination of translations, rotations and reflections. In less formal language, two sets are congruent if they have the same shape and size, but are in different positions (for instance one may be rotated, flipped, or simply placed somewhere else)." - Wikipedia</p>
